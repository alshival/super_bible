1,1,1,"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."
1,1,2,"And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."
1,1,3,"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light."
1,1,4,"And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness."
1,1,5,"And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day."
1,1,6,"And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."
1,1,7,"And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so."
1,1,8,"And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day."
1,1,9,"And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so."
1,1,10,"And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good."
1,1,11,"And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, `and' fruit-trees bearing fruit after their kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the earth: and it was so."
1,1,12,"And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after their kind: and God saw that it was good."
1,1,13,"And there was evening and there was morning, a third day."
1,1,14,"And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years:"
1,1,15,"and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so."
1,1,16,"And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: `he made' the stars also."
1,1,17,"And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth,"
1,1,18,"and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good."
1,1,19,"And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day."
1,1,20,"And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven."
1,1,21,"And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that moveth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind: and God saw that it was good."
1,1,22,"And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."
1,1,23,"And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day."
1,1,24,"And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind: and it was so."
1,1,25,"And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the ground after its kind: and God saw that it was good."
1,1,26,"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."
1,1,27,"And God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."
1,1,28,"And God blessed them: and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."
1,1,29,"And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food:"
1,1,30,"and to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, `I have given' every green herb for food: and it was so."
1,1,31,"And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day."
1,2,1,"And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them."
1,2,2,"And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made."
1,2,3,"And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it he rested from all his work which God had created and made."
1,2,4,"These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven."
1,2,5,"And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth: and there was not a man to till the ground;"
1,2,6,"but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground."
1,2,7,"And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."
1,2,8,"And Jehovah God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed."
1,2,9,"And out of the ground made Jehovah God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil."
1,2,10,"And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads."
1,2,11,"The name of the first is Pishon: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;"
1,2,12,"and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone."
1,2,13,"And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush."
1,2,14,"And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth in front of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates."
1,2,15,"And Jehovah God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it."
1,2,16,"And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:"
1,2,17,"but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."
1,2,18,"And Jehovah God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him."
1,2,19,"And out of the ground Jehovah God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them: and whatsoever the man called every living creature, that was the name thereof."
1,2,20,"And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but for man there was not found a help meet for him."
1,2,21,"And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof:"
1,2,22,"and the rib, which Jehovah God had taken from the man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man."
1,2,23,"And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man."
1,2,24,"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh."
1,2,25,"And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed."
1,3,1,"Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which Jehovah God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden?"
1,3,2,"And the woman said unto the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat:"
1,3,3,"but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die."
1,3,4,"And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:"
1,3,5,"for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil."
1,3,6,"And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat."
1,3,7,"And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons."
1,3,8,"And they heard the voice of Jehovah God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God amongst the trees of the garden."
1,3,9,"And Jehovah God called unto the man, and said unto him, Where art thou?"
1,3,10,"And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself."
1,3,11,"And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?"
1,3,12,"And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat."
1,3,13,"And Jehovah God said unto the woman, What is this thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat."
1,3,14,"And Jehovah God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:"
1,3,15,"and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."
1,3,16,"Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy conception; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee."
1,3,17,"And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;"
1,3,18,"thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;"
1,3,19,"in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return."
1,3,20,"And the man called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living."
1,3,21,"And Jehovah God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed them."
1,3,22,"And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever-"
1,3,23,"therefore Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken."
1,3,24,"So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life."
1,4,1,"And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man with `the help of' Jehovah."
1,4,2,"And again she bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground."
1,4,3,"And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Jehovah."
1,4,4,"And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And Jehovah had respect unto Abel and to his offering:"
1,4,5,"but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell."
1,4,6,"And Jehovah said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?"
1,4,7,"If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door: and unto thee shall be its desire, but do thou rule over it."
1,4,8,"And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him."
1,4,9,"And Jehovah said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother's keeper?"
1,4,10,"And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground."
1,4,11,"And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;"
1,4,12,"when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee its strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth."
1,4,13,"And Cain said unto Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear."
1,4,14,"Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me."
1,4,15,"And Jehovah said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should smite him."
1,4,16,"And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden."
1,4,17,"And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch."
1,4,18,"And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methushael; and Methushael begat Lamech."
1,4,19,"And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah."
1,4,20,"And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and `have' cattle."
1,4,21,"And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe."
1,4,22,"And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah."
1,4,23,"And Lamech said unto his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: For I have slain a man for wounding me, And a young man for bruising me:"
1,4,24,"If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold."
1,4,25,"And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth. For, `said she', God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him."
1,4,26,"And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh. Then began men to call upon the name of Jehovah."
1,5,1,"This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;"
1,5,2,"male and female created he them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created."
1,5,3,"And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat `a son' in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth:"
1,5,4,"and the days of Adam after he begat Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters."
1,5,5,"And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died."
1,5,6,"And Seth lived a hundred and five years, and begat Enosh:"
1,5,7,"and Seth lived after he begat Enosh eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters:"
1,5,8,"and all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died."
1,5,9,"And Enosh lived ninety years, and begat Kenan."
1,5,10,"and Enosh lived after he begat Kenan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:"
1,5,11,"and all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years: and he died."
1,5,12,"And Kenan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalalel:"
1,5,13,"and Kenan lived after he begat Mahalalel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters:"
1,5,14,"and all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died."
1,5,15,"And Mahalalel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:"
1,5,16,"And Mahalalel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:"
1,5,17,"and all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died."
1,5,18,"And Jared lived a hundred sixty and two years, and begat Enoch:"
1,5,19,"and Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:"
1,5,20,"And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died."
1,5,21,"And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:"
1,5,22,"and Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:"
1,5,23,"and all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:"
1,5,24,"and Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him."
1,5,25,"And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech:"
1,5,26,"and Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters."
1,5,27,"And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died."
1,5,28,"And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:"
1,5,29,"and he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands, `which cometh' because of the ground which Jehovah hath cursed."
1,5,30,"And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:"
1,5,31,"And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died."
1,5,32,"And Noah was five hundred years old: And Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
1,6,1,"And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born unto them,"
1,6,2,"that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all that they chose."
1,6,3,"And Jehovah said, My spirit shall not strive with man for ever, for that he also is flesh: yet shall his days be a hundred and twenty years."
1,6,4,"The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them: the same were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown."
1,6,5,"And Jehovah saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually."
1,6,6,"And it repented Jehovah that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart."
1,6,7,"And Jehovah said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the ground; both man, and beast, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; for it repenteth me that I have made them."
1,6,8,"But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah."
1,6,9,"These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, `and' perfect in his generations: Noah walked with God."
1,6,10,"And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
1,6,11,"And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence."
1,6,12,"And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth."
1,6,13,"And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth."
1,6,14,"Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch."
1,6,15,"And this is how thou shalt make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits."
1,6,16,"A light shalt thou make to the ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it upward; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it."
1,6,17,"And I, behold, I do bring the flood of waters upon this earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; everything that is in the earth shall die."
1,6,18,"But I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee."
1,6,19,"And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female."
1,6,20,"Of the birds after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive."
1,6,21,"And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them."
1,6,22,"Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he."
1,7,1,"And Jehovah said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation."
1,7,2,"Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven and seven, the male and his female; and of the beasts that are not clean two, the male and his female:"
1,7,3,"of the birds also of the heavens, seven and seven, male and female, to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth."
1,7,4,"For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the ground."
1,7,5,"And Noah did according unto all that Jehovah commanded him."
1,7,6,"And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth."
1,7,7,"And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood."
1,7,8,"Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creepeth upon the ground,"
1,7,9,"there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, male and female, as God commanded Noah."
1,7,10,"And it came to pass after the seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth."
1,7,11,"In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened."
1,7,12,"And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights."
1,7,13,"In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;"
1,7,14,"they, and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort."
1,7,15,"And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life."
1,7,16,"And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him: and Jehovah shut him in."
1,7,17,"And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth."
1,7,18,"And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters."
1,7,19,"And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered."
1,7,20,"Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered."
1,7,21,"And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both birds, and cattle, and beasts, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:"
1,7,22,"all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died."
1,7,23,"And every living thing was destroyed that was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only was left, and they that were with him in the ark."
1,7,24,"And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days."
1,8,1,"And God remembered Noah, and all the beasts, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged;"
1,8,2,"the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;"
1,8,3,"and the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters decreased."
1,8,4,"And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat."
1,8,5,"And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen."
1,8,6,"And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:"
1,8,7,"and he sent forth a raven, and it went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth."
1,8,8,"And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;"
1,8,9,"but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him to the ark; for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her in unto him into the ark."
1,8,10,"And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;"
1,8,11,"and the dove came in to him at eventide; and, lo, in her mouth an olive-leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth."
1,8,12,"And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove; and she returned not again unto him any more."
1,8,13,"And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dried."
1,8,14,"And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dry."
1,8,15,"And God spake unto Noah, saying,"
1,8,16,"Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee."
1,8,17,"Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh, both birds, and cattle, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth."
1,8,18,"And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:"
1,8,19,"every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatsoever moveth upon the earth, after their families, went forth out of the ark."
1,8,20,"And Noah builded an altar unto Jehovah, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar."
1,8,21,"And Jehovah smelled the sweet savor; and Jehovah said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake, for that the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more everything living, as I have done."
1,8,22,"While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."
1,9,1,"And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth."
1,9,2,"And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every bird of the heavens; With all wherewith the ground teemeth, and all the fishes of the sea, into your hand are they delivered."
1,9,3,"Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; As the green herb have I given you all."
1,9,4,"But flesh with the life thereof, `which is' the blood thereof, shall ye not eat."
1,9,5,"And surely your blood, `the blood' of your lives, will I require; At the hand of every beast will I require it. And at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man's brother, will I require the life of man."
1,9,6,"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: For in the image of God made he man."
1,9,7,"And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; Bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein."
1,9,8,"And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,"
1,9,9,"And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;"
1,9,10,"and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you. Of all that go out of the ark, even every beast of the earth."
1,9,11,"And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth."
1,9,12,"And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:"
1,9,13,"I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth."
1,9,14,"And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud,"
1,9,15,"and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh."
1,9,16,"And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth."
1,9,17,"And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth."
1,9,18,"And the sons of Noah, that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan."
1,9,19,"These three were the sons of Noah: and of these was the whole earth overspread."
1,9,20,"And Noah began to be a husbandman, and planted a vineyard:"
1,9,21,"and he drank of the wine, and was drunken. And he was uncovered within his tent."
1,9,22,"And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without."
1,9,23,"And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father. And their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness."
1,9,24,"And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done unto him."
1,9,25,"And he said, Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren."
1,9,26,"And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant."
1,9,27,"God enlarge Japheth, And let him dwell in the tents of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant."
1,9,28,"And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years."
1,9,29,"And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: And he died."
1,10,1,"Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, `namely', of Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood."
1,10,2,"The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras."
1,10,3,"And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah."
1,10,4,"And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim."
1,10,5,"Of these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands, every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations."
1,10,6,"And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan."
1,10,7,"And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan."
1,10,8,"And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth."
1,10,9,"He was a mighty hunter before Jehovah: wherefore it is said, Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before Jehovah."
1,10,10,"And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar."
1,10,11,"Out of that land he went forth into Assyria, and builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-ir, and Calah,"
1,10,12,"and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city)."
1,10,13,"And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,"
1,10,14,"and Pathrusim, and Casluhim (whence went forth the Philistines), and Caphtorim."
1,10,15,"And Canaan begat Sidon his first-born, and Heth,"
1,10,16,"and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,"
1,10,17,"and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,"
1,10,18,"and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread abroad."
1,10,19,"And the border of the Canaanite was from Sidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, unto Lasha."
1,10,20,"These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations."
1,10,21,"And unto Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born."
1,10,22,"The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram."
1,10,23,"And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash."
1,10,24,"And Arpachshad begat Shelah; and Shelah begat Eber."
1,10,25,"And unto Eber were born two sons: The name of the one was Peleg. For in his days was the earth divided. And his brother's name was Joktan."
1,10,26,"And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,"
1,10,27,"and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,"
1,10,28,"and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,"
1,10,29,"and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan."
1,10,30,"And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest toward Sephar, the mountain of the east."
1,10,31,"These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations."
1,10,32,"These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood."
1,11,1,"And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech."
1,11,2,"And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there."
1,11,3,"And they said one to another, Come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar."
1,11,4,"And they said, Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top `may reach' unto heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth."
1,11,5,"And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded."
1,11,6,"And Jehovah said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do: and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do."
1,11,7,"Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech."
1,11,8,"So Jehovah scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off building the city."
1,11,9,"Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because Jehovah did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did Jehovah scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth."
1,11,10,"These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and begat Arpachshad two years after the flood."
1,11,11,"and Shem lived after he begat Arpachshad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters."
1,11,12,"And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begat Shelah."
1,11,13,"and Arpachshad lived after he begat Shelah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters."
1,11,14,"And Shelah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:"
1,11,15,"and Shelah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters."
1,11,16,"And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:"
1,11,17,"and Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters."
1,11,18,"And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:"
1,11,19,"and Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters."
1,11,20,"And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:"
1,11,21,"and Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters."
1,11,22,"And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:"
1,11,23,"and Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters."
1,11,24,"And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:"
1,11,25,"and Nahor lived after he begat Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters."
1,11,26,"And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran."
1,11,27,"Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran begat Lot."
1,11,28,"And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees."
1,11,29,"And Abram and Nahor took them wives: The name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah."
1,11,30,"And Sarai was barren; She had no child."
1,11,31,"And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there."
1,11,32,"And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran."
1,12,1,"Now Jehovah said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto the land that I will show thee:"
1,12,2,"and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make they name great; and be thou a blessing;"
1,12,3,"and I will bless them that bless thee, and him that curseth thee will I curse: and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed."
1,12,4,"So Abram went, as Jehovah had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran."
1,12,5,"And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came."
1,12,6,"And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the oak of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land."
1,12,7,"And Jehovah appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto Jehovah, who appeared unto him."
1,12,8,"And he removed from thence unto the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto Jehovah, and called upon the name of Jehovah."
1,12,9,"And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South."
1,12,10,"And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was sore in the land."
1,12,11,"And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:"
1,12,12,"and it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive."
1,12,13,"Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister; that it may be well with me for thy sake, and that my soul may live because of thee."
1,12,14,"And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair."
1,12,15,"And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house."
1,12,16,"And he dealt well with Abram for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels."
1,12,17,"And Jehovah plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife."
1,12,18,"And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?"
1,12,19,"why saidst thou, She is my sister, so that I took her to be my wife? now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way."
1,12,20,"And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him: and they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had."
1,13,1,"And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South."
1,13,2,"And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold."
1,13,3,"And he went on his journeys from the South even to Beth-el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Ai,"
1,13,4,"unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of Jehovah."
1,13,5,"And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents."
1,13,6,"And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together."
1,13,7,"And there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the herdsmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land."
1,13,8,"And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen; for we are brethren."
1,13,9,"Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me. If `thou wilt take' the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if `thou take' the right hand, then I will go to the left."
1,13,10,"And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the Plain of the Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt, as thou goest unto Zoar."
1,13,11,"So Lot chose him all the Plain of the Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other."
1,13,12,"Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the Plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom."
1,13,13,"Now the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against Jehovah exceedingly."
1,13,14,"And Jehovah said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward and southward and eastward and westward:"
1,13,15,"for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever."
1,13,16,"And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: So that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then may thy seed also be numbered."
1,13,17,"Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for unto thee will I give it."
1,13,18,"And Abram moved his tent, and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built there an altar unto Jehovah."
1,14,1,"And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,"
1,14,2,"that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar)."
1,14,3,"All these joined together in the vale of Siddim (the same is the Salt Sea)."
1,14,4,"Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled."
1,14,5,"And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,"
1,14,6,"and the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness."
1,14,7,"And they returned, and came to En-mishpat (the same is Kadesh), and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon-tamar."
1,14,8,"And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar); and they set the battle in array against them in the vale of Siddim;"
1,14,9,"against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five."
1,14,10,"Now the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and they that remained fled to the mountain."
1,14,11,"And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way."
1,14,12,"And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed."
1,14,13,"And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew: now he dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and these were confederate with Abram."
1,14,14,"And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan."
1,14,15,"And he divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus."
1,14,16,"And he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people."
1,14,17,"And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, at the vale of Shaveh (the same is the King's Vale)."
1,14,18,"And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was priest of God Most High."
1,14,19,"And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth:"
1,14,20,"and blessed be God Most High, who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him a tenth of all."
1,14,21,"And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself."
1,14,22,"And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up my hand unto Jehovah, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,"
1,14,23,"that I will not take a thread nor a shoe-latchet nor aught that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:"
1,14,24,"save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men that went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their portion."
1,15,1,"After these things the word of Jehovah came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, `and' thy exceeding great reward."
1,15,2,"And Abram said, O Lord Jehovah, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and he that shall be possessor of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?"
1,15,3,"And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir."
1,15,4,"And, behold, the word of Jehovah came unto him, saying, This man shall not be thine heir; But he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir."
1,15,5,"And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and number the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be."
1,15,6,"And he believed in Jehovah; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness."
1,15,7,"And he said unto him, I am Jehovah that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it."
1,15,8,"And he said, O Lord Jehovah, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?"
1,15,9,"And he said unto him, Take me a heifer three years old, and a she-goat three years old, and a ram three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon."
1,15,10,"And he took him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each half over against the other: but the birds divided he not."
1,15,11,"And the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away."
1,15,12,"And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him."
1,15,13,"And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be sojourners in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;"
1,15,14,"and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance."
1,15,15,"But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age."
1,15,16,"And in the fourth generation they shall come hither again; for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full."
1,15,17,"And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces."
1,15,18,"In that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:"
1,15,19,"the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite,"
1,15,20,"and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim,"
1,15,21,"and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite."
1,16,1,"Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bare him no children: and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar."
1,16,2,"And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, Jehovah hath restrained me from bearing; go in, I pray thee, unto my handmaid; it may be that I shall obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai."
1,16,3,"And Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife."
1,16,4,"And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes."
1,16,5,"And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I gave my handmaid into they bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: Jehovah judge between me and thee."
1,16,6,"But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her that which is good in thine eyes. And Sarai dealt hardly with her, and she fled from her face."
1,16,7,"And the angel of Jehovah found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur."
1,16,8,"And he said, Hagar, Sarai's handmaid, whence camest thou? and whither goest thou? And she said, I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai."
1,16,9,"And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands."
1,16,10,"And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, I will greatly multiply thy seed, that it shall not be numbered for multitude."
1,16,11,"And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son; and thou shalt call his name Ishmael, because Jehovah hath heard thy affliction."
1,16,12,"And he shall be `as' a wild ass among men; his hand `shall be' against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell over against all his brethren."
1,16,13,"And she called the name of Jehovah that spake unto her, Thou art a God that seeth: for she said, Have I even here looked after him that seeth me?"
1,16,14,"Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered."
1,16,15,"And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bare, Ishmael."
1,16,16,"And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram."
1,17,1,"And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, Jehovah appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be thou perfect."
1,17,2,"And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly."
1,17,3,"And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,"
1,17,4,"As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be the father of a multitude of nations."
1,17,5,"Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for the father of a multitude of nations have I made thee."
1,17,6,"And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee."
1,17,7,"And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee."
1,17,8,"And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God."
1,17,9,"And God said unto Abraham, And as for thee, thou shalt keep my covenant, thou, and thy seed after thee throughout their generations."
1,17,10,"This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee: every male among you shall be circumcised."
1,17,11,"And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of a covenant betwixt me and you."
1,17,12,"And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any foreigner that is not of thy seed."
1,17,13,"He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant."
1,17,14,"And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant."
1,17,15,"And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be."
1,17,16,"And I will bless her, and moreover I will give thee a son of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be `a mother of' nations; kings of peoples shall be of her."
1,17,17,"Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?"
1,17,18,"And Abraham said unto God, Oh that Ishmael might live before thee!"
1,17,19,"And God said, Nay, but Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him."
1,17,20,"And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation."
1,17,21,"But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year."
1,17,22,"And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham."
1,17,23,"And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him."
1,17,24,"And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin."
1,17,25,"And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin."
1,17,26,"In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son."
1,17,27,"And all the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with money of a foreigner, were circumcised with him."
1,18,1,"And Jehovah appeared unto him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;"
1,18,2,"and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood over against him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,"
1,18,3,"and said, My lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:"
1,18,4,"let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:"
1,18,5,"and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and strengthen ye your heart; after that ye shall pass on: forasmuch as ye are come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said."
1,18,6,"And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes."
1,18,7,"And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto the servant; and he hasted to dress it."
1,18,8,"And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat."
1,18,9,"And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent."
1,18,10,"And he said, I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him."
1,18,11,"Now Abraham and Sarah were old, `and' well stricken in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women."
1,18,12,"And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?"
1,18,13,"And Jehovah said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, who am old?"
1,18,14,"Is anything too hard for Jehovah? At the set time I will return unto thee, when the season cometh round, and Sarah shall have a son."
1,18,15,"Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh."
1,18,16,"And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way."
1,18,17,"And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do;"
1,18,18,"seeing that Abraham had surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?"
1,18,19,"For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him."
1,18,20,"And Jehovah said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;"
1,18,21,"I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know."
1,18,22,"And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before Jehovah."
1,18,23,"And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou consume the righteous with the wicked?"
1,18,24,"Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?"
1,18,25,"That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from thee: shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"
1,18,26,"And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake."
1,18,27,"And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, who am but dust and ashes:"
1,18,28,"peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five."
1,18,29,"And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty's sake."
1,18,30,"And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there."
1,18,31,"And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the twenty's sake."
1,18,32,"And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten's sake."
1,18,33,"And Jehovah went his way, as soon as he had left off communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place."
1,19,1,"And the two angels came to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth;"
1,19,2,"and he said, Behold now, my lords, turn aside, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your way. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night."
1,19,3,"And he urged them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat."
1,19,4,"But before they lay down, the men of the city, `even' the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both young and old, all the people from every quarter;"
1,19,5,"and they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men that came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them."
1,19,6,"And Lot went out unto them to the door, and shut the door after him."
1,19,7,"And he said, I pray you, my brethren, do not so wickedly."
1,19,8,"Behold now, I have two daughters that have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing, forasmuch as they are come under the shadow of my roof."
1,19,9,"And they said, Stand back. And they said, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and drew near to break the door."
1,19,10,"But the men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door."
1,19,11,"And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door."
1,19,12,"And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whomsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of the place:"
1,19,13,"for we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxed great before Jehovah: and Jehovah hath sent us to destroy it."
1,19,14,"And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons-in-law, who married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for Jehovah will destroy the city. But he seemed unto his sons-in-law as one that mocked."
1,19,15,"And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters that are here, lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city."
1,19,16,"But he lingered; and the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters, Jehovah being merciful unto him; and they brought him forth, and set him without the city."
1,19,17,"And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the Plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed."
1,19,18,"And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my lord:"
1,19,19,"behold now, thy servant hath found favor in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy lovingkindness, which thou hast showed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die:"
1,19,20,"behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape thither (is it not a little one?), and my soul shall live."
1,19,21,"And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken."
1,19,22,"Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar."
1,19,23,"The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot came unto Zoar."
1,19,24,"Then Jehovah rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven;"
1,19,25,"and he overthrew those cities, and all the Plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground."
1,19,26,"But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt."
1,19,27,"And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before Jehovah:"
1,19,28,"and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the Plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace."
1,19,29,"And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the Plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt."
1,19,30,"And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters."
1,19,31,"And the first-born said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:"
1,19,32,"come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father."
1,19,33,"And they made their father drink wine that night: and the first-born went in, and lay with her father; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose."
1,19,34,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that the first-born said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father."
1,19,35,"And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose."
1,19,36,"Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father."
1,19,37,"And the first-born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day."
1,19,38,"And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day."
1,20,1,"And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the South, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur. And he sojourned in Gerar."
1,20,2,"And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister. And Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah."
1,20,3,"But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, because of the woman whom thou hast taken. For she is a man's wife."
1,20,4,"Now Abimelech had not come near her. And he said, Lord, wilt thou slay even a righteous nation?"
1,20,5,"Said he not himself unto me, She is my sister? And she, even she herself said, He is my brother. In the integrity of my heart and the innocency of my hands have I done this."
1,20,6,"And God said unto him in the dream, Yea, I know that in the integrity of thy heart thou has done this, and I also withheld thee from sinning against me. Therefore suffered I thee not to touch her."
1,20,7,"Now therefore restore the man's wife. For he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live. And if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine."
1,20,8,"And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ear. And the men were sore afraid."
1,20,9,"Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? And wherein have I sinned against thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? Thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done."
1,20,10,"And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?"
1,20,11,"And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place. And they will slay me for my wife's sake."
1,20,12,"And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife:"
1,20,13,"and it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me. At every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother."
1,20,14,"And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and men-servants and women-servants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife."
1,20,15,"And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee. Dwell where it pleaseth thee."
1,20,16,"And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee. And in respect of all thou art righted."
1,20,17,"And Abraham prayed unto God. And God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants. And they bare children."
1,20,18,"For Jehovah had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife."
1,21,1,"And Jehovah visited Sarah as he had said, and Jehovah did unto Sarah as he had spoken."
1,21,2,"And Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him."
1,21,3,"And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac."
1,21,4,"And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him."
1,21,5,"And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him."
1,21,6,"And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh. Every one that heareth will laugh with me."
1,21,7,"And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should give children suck? For I have borne him a son in his old age."
1,21,8,"And the child grew, and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned."
1,21,9,"And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne unto Abraham, mocking."
1,21,10,"Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this handmaid and her son. For the son of this handmaid shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac."
1,21,11,"And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight on account of his son."
1,21,12,"And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy handmaid. In all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice. For in Isaac shall thy seed be called."
1,21,13,"And also of the son of the handmaid will I make a nation, because he is thy seed."
1,21,14,"And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and `gave her' the child, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba."
1,21,15,"And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs."
1,21,16,"And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot. For she said, Let me not look upon the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept."
1,21,17,"And God heard the voice of the lad. And the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? Fear not. For God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is."
1,21,18,"Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thy hand. For I will make him a great nation."
1,21,19,"And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink."
1,21,20,"And God was with the lad, and he grew. And he dwelt in the wilderness, and became, as he grew up, an archer."
1,21,21,"And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran. And his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt."
1,21,22,"And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest."
1,21,23,"Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son. But according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned."
1,21,24,"And Abraham said, I will swear."
1,21,25,"And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away."
1,21,26,"And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing. Neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to-day."
1,21,27,"And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech. And they two made a covenant."
1,21,28,"And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves."
1,21,29,"And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?"
1,21,30,"And he said, These seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that it may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well."
1,21,31,"Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba. Because there they sware both of them."
1,21,32,"So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba. And Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines."
1,21,33,"And `Abraham' planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of Jehovah, the Everlasting God."
1,21,34,"And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days."
1,22,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that God did prove Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham. And he said, Here am I."
1,22,2,"And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah. And offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of."
1,22,3,"And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. And he clave the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him."
1,22,4,"On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off."
1,22,5,"And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder; and we will worship, and come again to you."
1,22,6,"And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. And they went both of them together."
1,22,7,"And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father. And he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold, the fire and the wood. But where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?"
1,22,8,"And Abraham said, God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son. So they went both of them together."
1,22,9,"And they came to the place which God had told him of. And Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood."
1,22,10,"And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son."
1,22,11,"And the angel of Jehovah called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Here I am."
1,22,12,"And he said, Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him. For now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me."
1,22,13,"And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind `him' a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son."
1,22,14,"And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh. As it is said to this day, In the mount of Jehovah it shall be provided."
1,22,15,"And the angel of Jehovah called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven,"
1,22,16,"and said, By myself have I sworn, saith Jehovah, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son,"
1,22,17,"that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is upon the seashore. And thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies."
1,22,18,"And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed. Because thou hast obeyed my voice."
1,22,19,"So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba. And Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba."
1,22,20,"And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also hath borne children unto they brother Nahor."
1,22,21,"Uz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram."
1,22,22,"And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel."
1,22,23,"And Bethuel begat Rebekah. These eight did Milcah bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother."
1,22,24,"And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bare Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maacah."
1,23,1,"And the life of Sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years. These were the years of the life of Sarah."
1,23,2,"And Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan. And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her."
1,23,3,"And Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spake unto the children of Heth, saying,"
1,23,4,"I am a stranger and a sojourner with you. Give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight."
1,23,5,"And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,"
1,23,6,"Hear us, my lord. Thou art a prince of God among us. In the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead. None of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead."
1,23,7,"And Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth."
1,23,8,"And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,"
1,23,9,"that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me in the midst of you for a possession of a burying-place."
1,23,10,"Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the children of Heth. And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,"
1,23,11,"Nay, my lord, hear me. The field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee. In the presence of the children of my people give I it thee. Bury thy dead."
1,23,12,"And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land."
1,23,13,"And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt, I pray thee, hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it of me, and I will bury my dead there."
1,23,14,"And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,"
1,23,15,"My lord, hearken unto me. A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that betwixt me and thee? Bury therefore thy dead."
1,23,16,"And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron. And Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current `money' with the merchant."
1,23,17,"So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the border thereof round about, were made sure"
1,23,18,"unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city."
1,23,19,"And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan."
1,23,20,"And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a burying-place by the children of Heth."
1,24,1,"And Abraham was old, `and' well stricken in age. And Jehovah had blessed Abraham in all things."
1,24,2,"And Abraham said unto his servant, the elder of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh."
1,24,3,"And I will make thee swear by Jehovah, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that thou wilt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell."
1,24,4,"But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac."
1,24,5,"And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land. Must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?"
1,24,6,"And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again."
1,24,7,"Jehovah, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house, and from the land of my nativity, and who spake unto me, and who sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land. He will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence."
1,24,8,"And if the woman be not willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath. Only thou shalt not bring my son thither again."
1,24,9,"And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning this matter."
1,24,10,"And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master, and departed, having all goodly things of his master's in his hand. And he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor."
1,24,11,"And he made the camels to kneel down without the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water."
1,24,12,"And he said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, send me, I pray thee, good speed this day, and show kindness unto my master Abraham."
1,24,13,"Behold, I am standing by the fountain of water. And the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water."
1,24,14,"And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink. And she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. Let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac. And thereby shall I know that thou hast showed kindness unto my master."
1,24,15,"And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder."
1,24,16,"And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her. And she went down to the fountain, and filled her pitcher, and came up."
1,24,17,"And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Give me to drink, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher."
1,24,18,"And she said, Drink, my lord. And she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink."
1,24,19,"And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw for thy camels also, until they have done drinking."
1,24,20,"And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw, and drew for all his camels."
1,24,21,"And the man looked stedfastly on her, holding his peace, to know whether Jehovah had made his journey prosperous or not."
1,24,22,"And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,"
1,24,23,"and said, Whose daughter art thou? Tell me, I pray thee. Is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?"
1,24,24,"And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bare unto Nahor."
1,24,25,"She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in."
1,24,26,"And the man bowed his head, and worshipped Jehovah."
1,24,27,"And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who hath not forsaken his lovingkindness and his truth toward my master. As for me, Jehovah hath led me in the way to the house of my master's brethren."
1,24,28,"And the damsel ran, and told her mother's house according to these words."
1,24,29,"And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the fountain."
1,24,30,"And it came to pass, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me. That he came unto the man. And, behold, he was standing by the camels at the fountain."
1,24,31,"And he said, Come in, thou blessed of Jehovah. Wherefore standest thou without? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels."
1,24,32,"And the man came into the house, and he ungirded the camels. And he gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men that were with him."
1,24,33,"And there was set food before him to eat. But he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on."
1,24,34,"And he said, I am Abraham's servant."
1,24,35,"And Jehovah hath blessed my master greatly. And he is become great. And he hath given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and men-servants and maid-servants, and camels and asses."
1,24,36,"And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old. And unto him hath he given all that he hath."
1,24,37,"And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell."
1,24,38,"But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son."
1,24,39,"And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me."
1,24,40,"And he said unto me, Jehovah, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way. And thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house."
1,24,41,"Then shalt thou be clear from my oath, when thou comest to my kindred. And if they give her not to thee, thou shalt be clear from my oath."
1,24,42,"And I came this day unto the fountain, and said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go."
1,24,43,"Behold, I am standing by the fountain of water. And let it come to pass, that the maiden that cometh forth to draw, to whom I shall say, Give me, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher to drink."
1,24,44,"And she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels. Let the same be the woman whom Jehovah hath appointed for my master's son."
1,24,45,"And before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder. And she went down unto the fountain, and drew. And I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee."
1,24,46,"And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. So I drank, and she made the camels drink also."
1,24,47,"And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him. And I put the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands."
1,24,48,"And I bowed my head, and worshipped Jehovah, and blessed Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter for his son."
1,24,49,"And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. And if not, tell me. That I may turn to the right hand, or to the left."
1,24,50,"Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from Jehovah. We cannot speak unto thee bad or good."
1,24,51,"Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as Jehovah hath spoken."
1,24,52,"And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth unto Jehovah."
1,24,53,"And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah. He gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things."
1,24,54,"And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night. And they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master."
1,24,55,"And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us `a few' days, at the least ten. After that she shall go."
1,24,56,"And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing Jehovah hath prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master."
1,24,57,"And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth."
1,24,58,"And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go."
1,24,59,"And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men."
1,24,60,"And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Our sister, be thou `the mother' of thousands of ten thousands, and let thy seed possess the gate of those that hate them."
1,24,61,"And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man. And the servant took Rebekah, and went his way."
1,24,62,"And Isaac came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi. For he dwelt in the land of the South."
1,24,63,"And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming."
1,24,64,"And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel."
1,24,65,"And she said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant said, It is my master. And she took her veil, and covered herself."
1,24,66,"And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done."
1,24,67,"And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife. And he loved her. And Isaac was comforted after his mother's death."
1,25,1,"And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah."
1,25,2,"And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah."
1,25,3,"And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim."
1,25,4,"And the sons of Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah."
1,25,5,"And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac."
1,25,6,"But unto the sons of the concubines, that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts. And he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country."
1,25,7,"And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, a hundred threescore and fifteen years."
1,25,8,"And Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full `of years', and was gathered to his people."
1,25,9,"And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre."
1,25,10,"The field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth. There was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife."
1,25,11,"And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son. And Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi."
1,25,12,"Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham."
1,25,13,"And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the first-born of Ishmael, Nebaioth, and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,"
1,25,14,"and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,"
1,25,15,"Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah."
1,25,16,"These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments. Twelve princes according to their nations."
1,25,17,"And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty and seven years. And he gave up the ghost and died, and was gathered unto his people."
1,25,18,"And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria. He abode over against all his brethren."
1,25,19,"And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son. Abraham begat Isaac."
1,25,20,"And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife."
1,25,21,"And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife, because she was barren. And Jehovah was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived."
1,25,22,"And the children struggled together within her. And she said, If it be so, wherefore do I live? And she went to inquire of Jehovah."
1,25,23,"And Jehovah said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, And two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels. And the one people shall be stronger than the other people. And the elder shall serve the younger."
1,25,24,"And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb."
1,25,25,"And the first came forth red, all over like a hairy garment. And they called his name Esau."
1,25,26,"And after that came forth his brother, and his hand had hold on Esau's heel. And his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them."
1,25,27,"And the boys grew. And Esau was a skilful hunter, a man of the field. And Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents."
1,25,28,"Now Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison. And Rebekah loved Jacob."
1,25,29,"And Jacob boiled pottage. And Esau came in from the field, and he was faint."
1,25,30,"And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red `pottage'. For I am faint. Therefore was his name called Edom."
1,25,31,"And Jacob said, Sell me first thy birthright."
1,25,32,"And Esau said, Behold, I am about to die. And what profit shall the birthright do to me?"
1,25,33,"And Jacob said, Swear to me first. And he sware unto him. And he sold his birthright unto Jacob."
1,25,34,"And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils. And he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright."
1,26,1,"And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines, unto Gerar."
1,26,2,"And Jehovah appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt. Dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of."
1,26,3,"Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee. For unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father."
1,26,4,"And I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these lands. And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed."
1,26,5,"Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."
1,26,6,"And Isaac dwelt in Gerar."
1,26,7,"And the men of the place asked him of his wife. And he said, She is my sister. For he feared to say, My wife. Lest, `said he', the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah. Because she was fair to look upon."
1,26,8,"And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife."
1,26,9,"And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife. And how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die because of her."
1,26,10,"And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? One of the people might easily have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldest have brought guiltiness upon us."
1,26,11,"And Abimelech charged all the people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death."
1,26,12,"And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in the same year a hundredfold. And Jehovah blessed him."
1,26,13,"And the man waxed great, and grew more and more until he became very great."
1,26,14,"And he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great household. And the Philistines envied him."
1,26,15,"Now all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth."
1,26,16,"And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us. For thou art much mightier than we."
1,26,17,"And Isaac departed thence, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there."
1,26,18,"And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father. For the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. And he called their names after the names by which his father had called them."
1,26,19,"And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water."
1,26,20,"And the herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, The water is ours. And he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him."
1,26,21,"And they digged another well, and they strove for that also. And he called the name of it Sitnah."
1,26,22,"And he removed from thence, and digged another well. And for that they strove not. And he called the name of it Rehoboth. And he said, For now Jehovah hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land."
1,26,23,"And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba."
1,26,24,"And Jehovah appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father. Fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake."
1,26,25,"And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of Jehovah, and pitched his tent there. And there Isaac's servants digged a well."
1,26,26,"Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his host."
1,26,27,"And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore are ye come unto me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?"
1,26,28,"And they said, We saw plainly that Jehovah was with thee. And we said, Let there now be an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee,"
1,26,29,"that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace. Thou art now the blessed of Jehovah."
1,26,30,"And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink."
1,26,31,"And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another. And Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace."
1,26,32,"And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water."
1,26,33,"And he called it Shibah. Therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day."
1,26,34,"And when Esau was forty years old he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite."
1,26,35,"And they were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah."
1,27,1,"And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said unto him, My son. And he said unto him, Here am I."
1,27,2,"And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death."
1,27,3,"Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me venison."
1,27,4,"And make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat. That my soul may bless thee before I die."
1,27,5,"And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it."
1,27,6,"And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,"
1,27,7,"Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless thee before Jehovah before my death."
1,27,8,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee."
1,27,9,"Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats. And I will make them savory food for thy father, such as he loveth."
1,27,10,"And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, so that he may bless thee before his death."
1,27,11,"And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man."
1,27,12,"My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver. And I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing."
1,27,13,"And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son. Only obey my voice, and go fetch me them."
1,27,14,"And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother. And his mother made savory food, such as his father loved."
1,27,15,"And Rebekah took the goodly garments of Esau her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son."
1,27,16,"And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck."
1,27,17,"And she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob."
1,27,18,"And he came unto his father, and said, My father. And he said, Here am I. Who art thou, my son?"
1,27,19,"And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first-born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me."
1,27,20,"And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because Jehovah thy God sent me good speed."
1,27,21,"And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not."
1,27,22,"And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father. And he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."
1,27,23,"And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands. So he blessed him."
1,27,24,"And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am."
1,27,25,"And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat. And he brought him wine, and he drank."
1,27,26,"And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son."
1,27,27,"And he came near, and kissed him. And he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son Is as the smell of a field which Jehovah hath blessed."
1,27,28,"And God give thee of the dew of heaven, And of the fatness of the earth, And plenty of grain and new wine."
1,27,29,"Let peoples serve thee, And nations bow down to thee. Be lord over thy brethren, And let thy mother's sons bow down to thee. Cursed be every one that curseth thee, And blessed be every one that blesseth thee."
1,27,30,"And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting."
1,27,31,"And he also made savory food, and brought it unto his father. And he said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me."
1,27,32,"And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy first-born, Esau."
1,27,33,"And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who then is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? Yea, `and' he shall be blessed."
1,27,34,"When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father."
1,27,35,"And he said, Thy brother came with guile, and hath taken away thy blessing."
1,27,36,"And he said, Is not he rightly name Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two time. He took away my birthright. And, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?"
1,27,37,"And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants. And with grain and new wine have I sustained him. And what then shall I do for thee, my son?"
1,27,38,"And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept."
1,27,39,"And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, of the fatness of the earth shall be thy dwelling, And of the dew of heaven from above."
1,27,40,"And by thy sword shalt thou live, and thou shalt serve thy brother. And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt break loose, That thou shalt shake his yoke from off thy neck."
1,27,41,"And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him. And Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then will I slay my brother Jacob."
1,27,42,"And the words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah. And she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, `purposing' to kill thee."
1,27,43,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. And arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran."
1,27,44,"And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away."
1,27,45,"Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him. Then I will send, and fetch thee from thence. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?"
1,27,46,"And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?"
1,28,1,"And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan."
1,28,2,"Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father. And take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother."
1,28,3,"And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a company of peoples."
1,28,4,"And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee. That thou mayest inherit the land of thy sojournings, which God gave unto Abraham."
1,28,5,"And Isaac sent away Jacob. And he went to Paddan-aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother."
1,28,6,"Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram, to take him a wife from thence. And that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan."
1,28,7,"And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan-aram."
1,28,8,"And Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father."
1,28,9,"And Esau went unto Ishmael, and took, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife."
1,28,10,"And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran."
1,28,11,"And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set. And he took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep."
1,28,12,"And he dreamed. And behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it."
1,28,13,"And, behold, Jehovah stood above it, and said, I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac. The land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed."
1,28,14,"And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. And in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed."
1,28,15,"And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee, whithersoever thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land. For I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of."
1,28,16,"And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely Jehovah is in this place. And I knew it not."
1,28,17,"And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."
1,28,18,"And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it."
1,28,19,"And he called the name of that place Beth-el. But the name of the city was Luz at the first."
1,28,20,"And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,"
1,28,21,"so that I come again to my father's house in peace, and Jehovah will be my God,"
1,28,22,"then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house. And of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee."
1,29,1,"Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east."
1,29,2,"And he looked, and behold, a well in the field, and, lo, three flocks of sheep lying there by it. For out of that well they watered the flocks. And the stone upon the well's mouth was great."
1,29,3,"And thither were all the flocks gathered. And they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in its place."
1,29,4,"And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence are ye? And they said, Of Haran are we."
1,29,5,"And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him."
1,29,6,"And he said unto them, Is it well with him? And they said, It is well. And, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep."
1,29,7,"And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together. Water ye the sheep, and go and feed them."
1,29,8,"And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well's mouth. Then we water the sheep."
1,29,9,"While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep. For she kept them."
1,29,10,"And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother."
1,29,11,"And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept."
1,29,12,"And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son. And she ran and told her father."
1,29,13,"And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things."
1,29,14,"And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month."
1,29,15,"And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? Tell me, what shall thy wages be?"
1,29,16,"And Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel."
1,29,17,"And Leah's eyes were tender. But Rachel was beautiful and well favored."
1,29,18,"And Jacob loved Rachel. And he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter."
1,29,19,"And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man. Abide with me."
1,29,20,"And Jacob served seven years for Rachel. And they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her."
1,29,21,"And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her."
1,29,22,"And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast."
1,29,23,"And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him. And he went in unto her."
1,29,24,"And Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid unto his daughter Leah for a handmaid."
1,29,25,"And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah. And he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? Did not I serve with thee for Rachel? Wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?"
1,29,26,"And Laban said, It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the first-born."
1,29,27,"Fulfil the week of this one, and we will give thee the other also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years."
1,29,28,"And jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. And he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife."
1,29,29,"And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid."
1,29,30,"And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years."
1,29,31,"And Jehovah saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb. But Rachel was barren."
1,29,32,"And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben. For she said, Because Jehovah hath looked upon my affliction. For now my husband will love me."
1,29,33,"And she conceived again, and bare a son: and said, Because Jehovah hath heard that I am hated, he hath therefore given me this `son' also. And she called his name Simeon."
1,29,34,"And she conceived again, and bare a son. And said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have borne him three sons. Therefore was his name called Levi."
1,29,35,"And she conceived again, and bare a son. And she said, This time will I praise Jehovah. Therefore she called his name Judah. And she left off bearing."
1,30,1,"And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and she said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die."
1,30,2,"And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?"
1,30,3,"And she said, Behold, my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; that she may bear upon my knees, and I also may obtain children by her."
1,30,4,"And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her."
1,30,5,"And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son."
1,30,6,"And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan."
1,30,7,"And Bilhah Rachel's handmaid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son."
1,30,8,"And Rachel said, With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali."
1,30,9,"When Leah saw that she had left off bearing, she took Zilpah her handmaid, and gave her to Jacob to wife."
1,30,10,"And Zilpah Leah's handmaid bare Jacob a son."
1,30,11,"And Leah said, Fortunate! and she called his name Gad."
1,30,12,"And Zilpah Leah's handmaid bare Jacob a second son."
1,30,13,"And Leah said, Happy am I! for the daughters will call me happy: and she called his name Asher."
1,30,14,"And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes."
1,30,15,"And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son's mandrakes."
1,30,16,"And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for I have surely hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night."
1,30,17,"And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob a fifth son."
1,30,18,"And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I gave my handmaid to my husband: and she called his name Issachar."
1,30,19,"And Leah conceived again, and bare a sixth son to Jacob."
1,30,20,"And Leah said, God hath endowed me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun."
1,30,21,"And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah."
1,30,22,"And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb."
1,30,23,"And she conceived, and bare a son: and said, God hath taken away my reproach:"
1,30,24,"and she called his name Joseph, saying, Jehovah add to me another son."
1,30,25,"And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country."
1,30,26,"Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service wherewith I have served thee."
1,30,27,"And Laban said unto him, If now I have found favor in thine eyes, `tarry': `for' I have divined that Jehovah hath blessed me for thy sake."
1,30,28,"And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it."
1,30,29,"And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle have fared with me."
1,30,30,"For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it hath increased unto a multitude; and Jehovah hath blessed thee whithersoever I turned: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?"
1,30,31,"And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me aught: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed thy flock and keep it."
1,30,32,"I will pass through all thy flock to-day, removing from thence every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and `of such' shall be my hire."
1,30,33,"So shall my righteousness answer for me hereafter, when thou shalt come concerning my hire that is before thee: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that `if found' with me, shall be counted stolen."
1,30,34,"And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word."
1,30,35,"And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstreaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons;"
1,30,36,"and he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks."
1,30,37,"And Jacob took him rods of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the plane-tree. And peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods."
1,30,38,"And he set the rods which he had peeled over against the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink; and they conceived when they came to drink."
1,30,39,"And the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth ringstreaked, speckled, and spotted."
1,30,40,"And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstreaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and put them not unto Laban's flock."
1,30,41,"And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger of the flock did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;"
1,30,42,"but when the flock were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's."
1,30,43,"And the man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and maid-servants and men-servants, and camels and asses."
1,31,1,"And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory."
1,31,2,"And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as beforetime."
1,31,3,"And Jehovah said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee."
1,31,4,"And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,"
1,31,5,"and said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as beforetime; but the God of my father hath been with me."
1,31,6,"And ye know that will all my power I have served your father."
1,31,7,"And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me."
1,31,8,"If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the flock bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstreaked shall be thy wages; then bare all the flock ringstreaked."
1,31,9,"Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me."
1,31,10,"And it came to pass at the time that the flock conceive, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled."
1,31,11,"And the angel of God said unto me in the dream, Jacob: and I said, Here am I."
1,31,12,"And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the he-goats which leap upon the flock are ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee."
1,31,13,"I am the God of Beth-el, where thou anointedst a pillar, where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy nativity."
1,31,14,"And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?"
1,31,15,"Are we not accounted by him as foreigners? for he hath sold us, and hath also quite devoured our money."
1,31,16,"For all the riches which God hath taken away from our father, that is ours and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do."
1,31,17,"Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon the camels;"
1,31,18,"and he carried away all his cattle, and all his substance which he had gathered, the cattle of his getting, which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to Isaac his father unto the land of Canaan."
1,31,19,"Now Laban was gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father's."
1,31,20,"And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled."
1,31,21,"So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead."
1,31,22,"And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled."
1,31,23,"And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and he overtook him in the mountain of Gilead."
1,31,24,"And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said unto him, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad."
1,31,25,"And Laban came up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain: and Laban with his brethren encamped in the mountain of Gilead."
1,31,26,"And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters as captives of the sword?"
1,31,27,"Wherefore didst thou flee secretly, and steal away from me, and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs, with tabret and with harp;"
1,31,28,"and didst not suffer me to kiss my sons and my daughters? now hast thou done foolishly."
1,31,29,"It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad."
1,31,30,"And now, `though' thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, `yet' wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?"
1,31,31,"And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Lest thou shouldest take thy daughters from me by force."
1,31,32,"With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them."
1,31,33,"And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two maid-servants; but he found them not. And he went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent."
1,31,34,"Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, and put them in the camel's saddle, and sat upon them. And Laban felt about all the tent, but found them not."
1,31,35,"And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee; for the manner of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the teraphim."
1,31,36,"And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast hotly pursued after me?"
1,31,37,"Whereas thou hast felt about all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us two."
1,31,38,"These twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flocks have I not eaten."
1,31,39,"That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night."
1,31,40,"Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from mine eyes."
1,31,41,"These twenty years have I been in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock: and thou hast changed my wages ten times."
1,31,42,"Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now hadst thou sent me away empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight."
1,31,43,"And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children whom they have borne?"
1,31,44,"And now come, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee."
1,31,45,"And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar."
1,31,46,"And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap: and they did eat there by the heap."
1,31,47,"And Laban called it Jegar-saha-dutha: but Jacob called it Galeed."
1,31,48,"And Laban said, This heap is witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed:"
1,31,49,"and Mizpah, for he said, Jehovah watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another."
1,31,50,"If thou shalt afflict my daughters, and if thou shalt take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee."
1,31,51,"And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the pillar, which I have set betwixt me and thee."
1,31,52,"This heap be witness, and the pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm."
1,31,53,"The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the Fear of his father Isaac."
1,31,54,"And Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mountain."
1,31,55,"And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed and returned unto his place."
1,32,1,"And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him."
1,32,2,"And Jacob said when he saw them, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim."
1,32,3,"And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom."
1,32,4,"And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now:"
1,32,5,"and I have oxen, and asses, `and' flocks, and men-servants, and maid-servants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in thy sight."
1,32,6,"And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him."
1,32,7,"Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;"
1,32,8,"and he said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the company which is left shall escape."
1,32,9,"And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, who saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good:"
1,32,10,"I am not worthy of the least of all the lovingkindnesses, and of all the truth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two companies."
1,32,11,"Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children."
1,32,12,"And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude."
1,32,13,"And he lodged there that night, and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother:"
1,32,14,"two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,"
1,32,15,"thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals."
1,32,16,"And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove."
1,32,17,"And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?"
1,32,18,"then thou shalt say `They are' thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, he also is behind us."
1,32,19,"And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him;"
1,32,20,"and ye shall say, Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me."
1,32,21,"So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the company."
1,32,22,"And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok."
1,32,23,"And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had."
1,32,24,"And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day."
1,32,25,"And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him."
1,32,26,"And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me."
1,32,27,"And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob."
1,32,28,"And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed."
1,32,29,"And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there."
1,32,30,"And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, `said he', I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved."
1,32,31,"And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he limped upon his thigh."
1,32,32,"Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew of the hip."
1,33,1,"And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids."
1,33,2,"And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost."
1,33,3,"And he himself passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother."
1,33,4,"And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept."
1,33,5,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are these with thee? And he said, The children whom God hath graciously given thy servant."
1,33,6,"Then the handmaids came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves."
1,33,7,"And Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves."
1,33,8,"And he said, What meanest thou by all this company which I met? And he said, To find favor in the sight of my lord."
1,33,9,"And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; let that which thou hast be thine."
1,33,10,"And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found favor in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand; forasmuch as I have seen thy face, as one seeth the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me."
1,33,11,"Take, I pray thee, my gift that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it."
1,33,12,"And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee."
1,33,13,"And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young: and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die."
1,33,14,"Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come unto my lord unto Seir."
1,33,15,"And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find favor in the sight of my lord."
1,33,16,"So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir."
1,33,17,"And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth."
1,33,18,"And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram; and encamped before the city."
1,33,19,"And he bought the parcel of ground, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred pieces of money."
1,33,20,"And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-israel."
1,34,1,"And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land."
1,34,2,"And Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her; And he took her, and lay with her, and humbled her."
1,34,3,"And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel."
1,34,4,"And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife."
1,34,5,"Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; and his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they came."
1,34,6,"And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him."
1,34,7,"And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done."
1,34,8,"And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you, give her unto him to wife."
1,34,9,"And make ye marriages with us; give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you."
1,34,10,"And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein."
1,34,11,"And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find favor in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give."
1,34,12,"Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife."
1,34,13,"And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with guile, and spake, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,"
1,34,14,"and said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us."
1,34,15,"Only on this condition will we consent unto you: if ye will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised;"
1,34,16,"then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people."
1,34,17,"But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone."
1,34,18,"And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son."
1,34,19,"And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was honored above all the house of his father."
1,34,20,"And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,"
1,34,21,"These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for, behold, the land is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters."
1,34,22,"Only on this condition will the men consent unto us to dwell with us, to become one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised."
1,34,23,"Shall not their cattle and their substance and all their beasts be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us."
1,34,24,"And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city."
1,34,25,"And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city unawares, and slew all the males."
1,34,26,"And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went forth."
1,34,27,"The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister."
1,34,28,"They took their flocks and their herds and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field;"
1,34,29,"and all their wealth, and all their little ones and their wives, took they captive and made a prey, even all that was in the house."
1,34,30,"And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and, I being few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and smite me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house."
1,34,31,"And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with a harlot?"
1,35,1,"And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, who appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother."
1,35,2,"Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments:"
1,35,3,"and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went."
1,35,4,"And they gave unto Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hand, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem."
1,35,5,"And they journeyed: and a terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob."
1,35,6,"So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (the same is Beth-el), he and all the people that were with him."
1,35,7,"And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el; because there God was revealed unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother."
1,35,8,"And Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried below Beth-el under the oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bacuth."
1,35,9,"And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him."
1,35,10,"And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel."
1,35,11,"And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;"
1,35,12,"and the land which I gave unto Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land."
1,35,13,"And God went up from him in the place where he spake with him."
1,35,14,"And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spake with him, a pillar of stone: and he poured out a drink-offering thereon, and poured oil thereon."
1,35,15,"And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Beth-el."
1,35,16,"And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was still some distance to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor."
1,35,17,"And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; for now thou shalt have another son."
1,35,18,"And it came to pass, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin."
1,35,19,"And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem)."
1,35,20,"And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave: the same is the Pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day."
1,35,21,"And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder."
1,35,22,"And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard of it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:"
1,35,23,"The sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's first-born, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun;"
1,35,24,"the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin;"
1,35,25,"and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid: Dan and Naphtali;"
1,35,26,"and the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Paddan-aram."
1,35,27,"And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre, to Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac sojourned."
1,35,28,"And the days of Isaac were a hundred and fourscore years."
1,35,29,"And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, old and full of days: and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him."
1,36,1,"Now these are the generations of Esau (the same is Edom)."
1,36,2,"Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,"
1,36,3,"and Basemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebaioth."
1,36,4,"And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Basemath bare Reuel;"
1,36,5,"and Oholibamah bare Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, that were born unto him in the land of Canaan."
1,36,6,"And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the souls of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his possessions, which he had gather in the land of Canaan; and went into a land away from his brother Jacob."
1,36,7,"For their substance was too great for them to dwell together; and the land of their sojournings could not bear them because of their cattle."
1,36,8,"And Esau dwelt in mount Seir: Esau is Edom."
1,36,9,"And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:"
1,36,10,"these are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau."
1,36,11,"And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz."
1,36,12,"And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these are the sons of Adah, Esau's wife."
1,36,13,"And these are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Basemath, Esau's wife."
1,36,14,"And these were the sons of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah."
1,36,15,"These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the first-born of Esau: chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz,"
1,36,16,"chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek: these are the chiefs that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Adah."
1,36,17,"And these are the sons of Reuel, Esau's son: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah: these are the chiefs that came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Basemath, Esau's wife."
1,36,18,"And these are the sons of Oholibamah, Esau's wife: chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah: these are the chiefs that came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife."
1,36,19,"These are the sons of Esau, and these are their chiefs: the same is Edom."
1,36,20,"These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan and Shobal and Zibeon and Anah,"
1,36,21,"and Dishon and Ezer and Dishan: these are the chiefs that came of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom."
1,36,22,"And the children of Lotan were Hori and Heman. And Lotan's sister was Timna."
1,36,23,"And these are the children of Shobal: Alvan and Manahath and Ebal, Shepho and Onam."
1,36,24,"And these are the children of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah; this is Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father."
1,36,25,"And these are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah."
1,36,26,"And these are the children of Dishon: Hemdan and Eshban and Ithran and Cheran."
1,36,27,"These are the children of Ezer: Bilhan and Zaavan and Akan."
1,36,28,"These are the children of Dishan: Uz and Aran."
1,36,29,"These are the chiefs that came of the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah,"
1,36,30,"chief Dishon, chief Ezer, chief Dishan: these are the chiefs that came of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir."
1,36,31,"And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel."
1,36,32,"And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom; and the name of his city was Dinhabah."
1,36,33,"And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead."
1,36,34,"And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his stead."
1,36,35,"And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith."
1,36,36,"And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead."
1,36,37,"And Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth by the River reigned in his stead."
1,36,38,"And Shaul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead."
1,36,39,"And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-zahab."
1,36,40,"And these are the names of the chiefs that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth,"
1,36,41,"chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon,"
1,36,42,"chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,"
1,36,43,"chief Magdiel, chief Iram: these are the chiefs of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession. This is Esau, the father of the Edomites."
1,37,1,"And Jacob dwelt in the land of his father's sojournings, in the land of Canaan."
1,37,2,"These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and he was a lad with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought the evil report of them unto their father."
1,37,3,"Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors."
1,37,4,"And his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren; and they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him."
1,37,5,"And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren: and they hated him yet the more."
1,37,6,"And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:"
1,37,7,"for, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves came round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf."
1,37,8,"And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? Or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words."
1,37,9,"And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed yet a dream: and, behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars made obeisance to me."
1,37,10,"And he told it to his father, and to his brethren; and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?"
1,37,11,"And his brethren envied him; but his father kept the saying in mind."
1,37,12,"And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem."
1,37,13,"And Israel said unto Joseph, Are not thy brethren feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I."
1,37,14,"And he said to him, Go now, see whether it is well with thy brethren, and well with the flock; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem."
1,37,15,"And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?"
1,37,16,"And he said, I am seeking my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they are feeding `the flock'."
1,37,17,"And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan."
1,37,18,"And they saw him afar off, and before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him."
1,37,19,"And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh."
1,37,20,"Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, And evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams."
1,37,21,"And Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, Let us not take his life."
1,37,22,"And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him: that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father."
1,37,23,"And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him;"
1,37,24,"and they took him, and cast him into the pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it."
1,37,25,"And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt."
1,37,26,"And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood?"
1,37,27,"Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brethren hearkened unto him."
1,37,28,"And there passed by Midianites, merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt."
1,37,29,"And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes."
1,37,30,"And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?"
1,37,31,"And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a he-goat, and dipped the coat in the blood;"
1,37,32,"and they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, This have we found: know now whether it is thy son's coat or not."
1,37,33,"And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat: an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces."
1,37,34,"And Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days."
1,37,35,"And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down to Sheol to my son mourning. And his father wept for him."
1,37,36,"And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard."
1,38,1,"And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah."
1,38,2,"And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. And he took her, and went in unto her."
1,38,3,"And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er."
1,38,4,"And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan."
1,38,5,"And she yet again bare a son, and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him."
1,38,6,"And Judah took a wife for Er his first-born, and her name was Tamar."
1,38,7,"And Er, Judah's first-born, was wicked in the sight of Jehovah. And Jehovah slew him."
1,38,8,"And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother unto her, and raise up seed to thy brother."
1,38,9,"And Onan knew that the seed would not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother."
1,38,10,"And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and he slew him also."
1,38,11,"Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown up; for he said, Lest he also die, like his brethren. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house."
1,38,12,"And in process of time Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheep-shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite."
1,38,13,"And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnah to shear his sheep."
1,38,14,"And she put off from her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she was not given unto him to wife."
1,38,15,"When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; for she had covered her face."
1,38,16,"And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Come, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee: for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?"
1,38,17,"And he said, I will send thee a kid of the goats from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?"
1,38,18,"And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet and thy cord, and thy staff that is in thy hand. And he gave them to her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him."
1,38,19,"And she arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood."
1,38,20,"And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not."
1,38,21,"Then he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the wayside? And they said, There hath been no prostitute here."
1,38,22,"And he returned to Judah, and said, I have not found her; and also the men of the place said, There hath been no prostitute here."
1,38,23,"And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be put to shame: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her."
1,38,24,"And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and moreover, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt."
1,38,25,"When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and the cords, and the staff."
1,38,26,"And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She is more righteous than I; forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more."
1,38,27,"And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb."
1,38,28,"And it came to pass, when she travailed, that one put out a hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first."
1,38,29,"And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, Wherefore hast thou made a breach for thyself? Therefore his name was called Perez."
1,38,30,"And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zerah."
1,39,1,"And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hand of the Ishmaelites, that had brought him down thither."
1,39,2,"And Jehovah was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian."
1,39,3,"And his master saw that Jehovah was with him, and that Jehovah made all that he did to prosper in his hand."
1,39,4,"And Joseph found favor in his sight, and he ministered unto him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand."
1,39,5,"And it came to pass from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that Jehovah blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of Jehovah was upon all that he had, in the house and in the field."
1,39,6,"And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not aught `that was' with him, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was comely, and well-favored."
1,39,7,"And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me."
1,39,8,"But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master knoweth not what is with me in the house, and he hath put all that he hath into my hand:"
1,39,9,"he is not greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back anything from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"
1,39,10,"And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, `or' to be with her."
1,39,11,"And it came to pass about this time, that he went into the house to do his work; and there was none of the men of the house there within."
1,39,12,"And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out."
1,39,13,"And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,"
1,39,14,"that she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in a Hebrew unto us to mock us: he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:"
1,39,15,"and it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled, and got him out."
1,39,16,"And she laid up his garment by her, until his master came home."
1,39,17,"And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, whom thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:"
1,39,18,"and it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled out."
1,39,19,"And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled."
1,39,20,"And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison."
1,39,21,"But Jehovah was with Joseph, and showed kindness unto him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison."
1,39,22,"And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it."
1,39,23,"The keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand, because Jehovah was with him; and that which he did, Jehovah made it prosper."
1,40,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of Egypt."
1,40,2,"And Pharaoh was wroth against his two officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers."
1,40,3,"And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound."
1,40,4,"And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he ministered unto them: and they continued a season in ward."
1,40,5,"And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison."
1,40,6,"And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and saw them, and, behold, they were sad."
1,40,7,"And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in ward in his master's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sad to-day?"
1,40,8,"And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell it me, I pray you."
1,40,9,"And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;"
1,40,10,"and in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, `and' its blossoms shot forth; `and' the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:"
1,40,11,"and Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand."
1,40,12,"And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days;"
1,40,13,"within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee unto thine office: and thou shalt give Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler."
1,40,14,"But have me in thy remembrance when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:"
1,40,15,"for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon."
1,40,16,"When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head:"
1,40,17,"and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked food for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head."
1,40,18,"And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: the three baskets are three days;"
1,40,19,"within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee."
1,40,20,"And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants."
1,40,21,"And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:"
1,40,22,"but he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them."
1,40,23,"Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him."
1,41,1,"And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river."
1,41,2,"And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, well-favored and fat-fleshed; and they fed in the reed-grass."
1,41,3,"And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill-favored and lean-fleshed, and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river."
1,41,4,"And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed kine did eat up the seven well-favored and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke."
1,41,5,"And he slept and dreamed a second time: and, behold, seven ears of grain came up upon one stalk, rank and good."
1,41,6,"And, behold, seven ears, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them."
1,41,7,"And the thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream."
1,41,8,"And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh."
1,41,9,"Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:"
1,41,10,"Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker:"
1,41,11,"and we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream."
1,41,12,"And there was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret."
1,41,13,"And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged."
1,41,14,"Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh."
1,41,15,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that when thou hearest a dream thou canst interpret it."
1,41,16,"And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace."
1,41,17,"And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the brink of the river:"
1,41,18,"and, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fat-fleshed and well-favored: and they fed in the reed-grass:"
1,41,19,"and, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill-favored and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:"
1,41,20,"and the lean and ill-favored kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:"
1,41,21,"and when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke."
1,41,22,"And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up upon one stalk, full and good:"
1,41,23,"and, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, `and' blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:"
1,41,24,"and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears: and I told it unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me."
1,41,25,"And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: what God is about to do he hath declared unto Pharaoh."
1,41,26,"The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one."
1,41,27,"And the seven lean and ill-favored kine that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind; they shall be seven years of famine."
1,41,28,"That is the thing which I spake unto Pharaoh: what God is about to do he hath showed unto Pharaoh."
1,41,29,"Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:"
1,41,30,"and there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;"
1,41,31,"and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine which followeth; for it shall be very grievous."
1,41,32,"And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh, it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass."
1,41,33,"Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt."
1,41,34,"Let Pharaoh do `this', and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years."
1,41,35,"And let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it."
1,41,36,"And the food shall be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine."
1,41,37,"And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants."
1,41,38,"And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom the spirit of God is?"
1,41,39,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath showed thee all of this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou:"
1,41,40,"thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou."
1,41,41,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt."
1,41,42,"And Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;"
1,41,43,"and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he set him over all the land of Egypt."
1,41,44,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt."
1,41,45,"And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt."
1,41,46,"And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt."
1,41,47,"And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls."
1,41,48,"And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same."
1,41,49,"And Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left off numbering; for it was without number."
1,41,50,"And unto Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bare unto him."
1,41,51,"And Joseph called the name of the first-born Manasseh: For, `said he', God hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house."
1,41,52,"And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction."
1,41,53,"And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, came to an end."
1,41,54,"And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said: and there was famine in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread."
1,41,55,"And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do."
1,41,56,"And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the store-houses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine was sore in the land of Egypt."
1,41,57,"And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was sore in all the earth."
1,42,1,"Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?"
1,42,2,"And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die."
1,42,3,"And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy grain from Egypt."
1,42,4,"But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest Peradventure harm befall him."
1,42,5,"And the sons of Israel came to buy among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan."
1,42,6,"And Joseph was the governor over the land; he it was that sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves to him with their faces to the earth."
1,42,7,"And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly with them; and he said unto them. Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food."
1,42,8,"And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him."
1,42,9,"And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come."
1,42,10,"And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come."
1,42,11,"We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies."
1,42,12,"And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come."
1,42,13,"And they said, We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not."
1,42,14,"And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:"
1,42,15,"hereby ye shall be proved: by the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither."
1,42,16,"Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be bound, that your words may be proved, whether there be truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies."
1,42,17,"And he put them all together into ward three days."
1,42,18,"And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live: for I fear God:"
1,42,19,"if ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in your prison-house; but go ye, carry grain for the famine of your houses:"
1,42,20,"and bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so."
1,42,21,"And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us."
1,42,22,"And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore also, behold, his blood is required."
1,42,23,"And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them."
1,42,24,"And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and he returned to them, and spake to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes."
1,42,25,"Then Joseph commanded to fill their vessels with grain, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provisions for the way: and thus was it done unto them."
1,42,26,"And they laded their asses with their grain, and departed thence."
1,42,27,"And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the lodging-place, he espied his money; and, behold, it was in the mouth of his sack."
1,42,28,"And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, What is this that God hath done unto us?"
1,42,29,"And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying,"
1,42,30,"The man, the lord of the land, spake roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country."
1,42,31,"And we said unto him, We are true men; and we are no spies:"
1,42,32,"we are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan."
1,42,33,"And the man, the lord of the land, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men: leave one of your brethren with me, and take `grain for' the famine of your houses, and go your way;"
1,42,34,"and bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffic in the land."
1,42,35,"And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid."
1,42,36,"And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me."
1,42,37,"And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again."
1,42,38,"And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left: if harm befall him by the way in which ye go, then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol."
1,43,1,"And the famine was sore in the land."
1,43,2,"And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food."
1,43,3,"And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you."
1,43,4,"If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:"
1,43,5,"but if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down; for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you."
1,43,6,"And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?"
1,43,7,"And they said, The man asked straitly concerning ourselves, and concerning our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye `another' brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we in any wise know that he would say, Bring your brother down?"
1,43,8,"And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones."
1,43,9,"I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:"
1,43,10,"for except we had lingered, surely we had now returned a second time."
1,43,11,"And their father Israel said unto them, If it be so now, do this: take of the choice fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spicery and myrrh, nuts, and almonds;"
1,43,12,"and take double money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks carry again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:"
1,43,13,"take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:"
1,43,14,"and God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release unto you your other brother and Benjamin. And if I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved."
1,43,15,"And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph."
1,43,16,"And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, Bring the men into the house, and slay, and make ready; for the men shall dine with me at noon."
1,43,17,"And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men to Joseph's house."
1,43,18,"And the men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses."
1,43,19,"And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they spake unto him at the door of the house,"
1,43,20,"and said, Oh, my lord, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:"
1,43,21,"and it came to pass, when we came to the lodging-place, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand."
1,43,22,"And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food: we know not who put our money in our sacks."
1,43,23,"And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them."
1,43,24,"And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. And he gave their asses provender."
1,43,25,"And they made ready the present against Joseph's coming at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there."
1,43,26,"And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed down themselves to him to the earth."
1,43,27,"And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?"
1,43,28,"And they said, Thy servant our father is well, he is yet alive. And they bowed the head, and made obeisance."
1,43,29,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother's son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son."
1,43,30,"And Joseph made haste; for his heart yearned over his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there."
1,43,31,"And he washed his face, and came out; and he refrained himself, and said, Set on bread."
1,43,32,"And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, that did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians."
1,43,33,"And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one with another."
1,43,34,"And he took `and sent' messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him."
1,44,1,"And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth."
1,44,2,"And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his grain money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken."
1,44,3,"As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses."
1,44,4,"`And' when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?"
1,44,5,"Is not this that in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? ye have done evil in so doing."
1,44,6,"And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these words."
1,44,7,"And they said unto him, Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? Far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing."
1,44,8,"Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?"
1,44,9,"With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen."
1,44,10,"And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my bondman; and ye shall be blameless."
1,44,11,"Then they hasted, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack."
1,44,12,"And he searched, `and' began at the eldest, and left off at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack."
1,44,13,"Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city."
1,44,14,"And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; and he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground."
1,44,15,"And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? know ye not that such a man as I can indeed divine?"
1,44,16,"And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found."
1,44,17,"And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father."
1,44,18,"Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh, my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh."
1,44,19,"My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?"
1,44,20,"And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loveth him."
1,44,21,"And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him."
1,44,22,"And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die."
1,44,23,"And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more."
1,44,24,"And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord."
1,44,25,"And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food."
1,44,26,"And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, expect our youngest brother be with us."
1,44,27,"And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:"
1,44,28,"and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since:"
1,44,29,"and if ye take this one also from me, and harm befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol."
1,44,30,"Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;"
1,44,31,"it will come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not `with us', that he will die: and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to Sheol."
1,44,32,"For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever."
1,44,33,"Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren."
1,44,34,"For how shall I go up to my father, if the lad be not with me? lest I see the evil that shall come on my father."
1,45,1,"Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood before him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren."
1,45,2,"And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard."
1,45,3,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence."
1,45,4,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt."
1,45,5,"And now be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life."
1,45,6,"For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and there are yet five years, in which there shall be neither plowing nor harvest."
1,45,7,"And God sent me before you to preserve you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance."
1,45,8,"So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt."
1,45,9,"Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not;"
1,45,10,"and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:"
1,45,11,"and there will I nourish thee; for there are yet five years of famine; lest thou come to poverty, thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast."
1,45,12,"And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you."
1,45,13,"And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen: and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither."
1,45,14,"And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck."
1,45,15,"And he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him."
1,45,16,"And the report thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants."
1,45,17,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye: lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;"
1,45,18,"and take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land."
1,45,19,"Now thou art commanded, this do ye: take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come."
1,45,20,"Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours."
1,45,21,"And the sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way."
1,45,22,"To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment."
1,45,23,"And to his father he sent after this manner: ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way."
1,45,24,"So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way."
1,45,25,"And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father."
1,45,26,"And they told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt. And his heart fainted, for he believed them not."
1,45,27,"And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:"
1,45,28,"and Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die."
1,46,1,"And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac."
1,46,2,"And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I."
1,46,3,"And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:"
1,46,4,"I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes."
1,46,5,"And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him."
1,46,6,"And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:"
1,46,7,"his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons's daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt."
1,46,8,"And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's first-born."
1,46,9,"And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, and Pallu, and Hezron, and Carmi."
1,46,10,"And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman."
1,46,11,"And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
1,46,12,"And the sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul."
1,46,13,"And the sons of Issachar: Tola, and Puvah, and Iob, and Shimron."
1,46,14,"And the sons of Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel."
1,46,15,"These are the sons of Leah, whom she bare unto Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three."
1,46,16,"And the sons of Gad: Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli."
1,46,17,"And the sons of Asher: Imnah, and Ishvah, and Ishvi, and Beriah, and Serah their sister; and the sons of Beriah: Heber, and Malchiel."
1,46,18,"These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter; and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls."
1,46,19,"The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin."
1,46,20,"And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On, bare unto him."
1,46,21,"And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard."
1,46,22,"These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen."
1,46,23,"And the sons of Dan: Hushim."
1,46,24,"And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem."
1,46,25,"These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob: all the souls were seven."
1,46,26,"All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, that came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six;"
1,46,27,"and the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were threescore and ten."
1,46,28,"And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to show the way before him unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen."
1,46,29,"And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen; and he presented himself unto him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while."
1,46,30,"And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, that thou art yet alive."
1,46,31,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and tell Pharaoh, and will say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;"
1,46,32,"and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have."
1,46,33,"And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?"
1,46,34,"that ye shall say, Thy servants have been keepers of cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians."
1,47,1,"Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen."
1,47,2,"And from among his brethren he took five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh."
1,47,3,"And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers."
1,47,4,"And they said unto Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land are we come; for there is no pasture for thy servants' flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen."
1,47,5,"And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:"
1,47,6,"the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and thy brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any able men among them, then make them rulers over my cattle."
1,47,7,"And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh."
1,47,8,"And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How many are the days of the years of thy life?"
1,47,9,"And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years: few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage."
1,47,10,"And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh."
1,47,11,"And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded."
1,47,12,"And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families."
1,47,13,"And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine."
1,47,14,"And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house."
1,47,15,"And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for `our' money faileth."
1,47,16,"And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail."
1,47,17,"And they brought their cattle unto Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year."
1,47,18,"And when that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are my lord's; there is nought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:"
1,47,19,"wherefore should we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land be not desolate."
1,47,20,"So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine was sore upon them: and the land became Pharaoh's."
1,47,21,"And as for the people, he removed them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end thereof."
1,47,22,"Only the land of the priests bought he not: for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them; wherefore they sold not their land."
1,47,23,"Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land."
1,47,24,"And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings, that ye shall give a fifth unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones."
1,47,25,"And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants."
1,47,26,"And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone became not Pharaoh's."
1,47,27,"And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they gat them possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly."
1,47,28,"And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred forty and seven years."
1,47,29,"And the time drew near that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found favor in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me: bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt;"
1,47,30,"but when I sleep with my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place. And he said, I will do as thou hast said."
1,47,31,"And he said, Swear unto me: and he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head."
1,48,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that one said to Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim."
1,48,2,"And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed."
1,48,3,"And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,"
1,48,4,"and said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company of peoples, and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession."
1,48,5,"And now thy two sons, who were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine."
1,48,6,"And thy issue, that thou begettest after them, shall be thine; they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance."
1,48,7,"And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when there was still some distance to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem)."
1,48,8,"And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?"
1,48,9,"And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me here. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them."
1,48,10,"Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them."
1,48,11,"And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath let me see thy seed also."
1,48,12,"And Joseph brought them out from between his knees; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth."
1,48,13,"And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him."
1,48,14,"And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the first-born."
1,48,15,"And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God who hath fed me all my life long unto this day,"
1,48,16,"the angel who hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth."
1,48,17,"And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head."
1,48,18,"And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father; for this is the first-born; put thy right hand upon his head."
1,48,19,"And his father refused, and said, I know `it', my son, I know `it'. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: howbeit his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations."
1,48,20,"And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee will Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh."
1,48,21,"And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God will be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers."
1,48,22,"Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow."
1,49,1,"And Jacob called unto his sons, and said: gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the latter days."
1,49,2,"Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; And hearken unto Israel your father."
1,49,3,"Reuben, thou art my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength; The pre-eminence of dignity, and the pre-eminence of power."
1,49,4,"Boiling over as water, thou shalt not have the pre-eminence; Because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; Then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch."
1,49,5,"Simeon and Levi are brethren; Weapons of violence are their swords."
1,49,6,"O my soul, come not thou into their council; Unto their assembly, my glory, be not thou united; For in their anger they slew a man, And in their self-will they hocked an ox."
1,49,7,"Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; And their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, And scatter them in Israel."
1,49,8,"Judah, thee shall thy brethren praise: Thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies; Thy father's sons shall bow down before thee."
1,49,9,"Judah is a lion's whelp; From the prey, my son, thou art gone up: He stooped down, he couched as a lion, And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up?"
1,49,10,"The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, Nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, Until Shiloh come: And unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be."
1,49,11,"Binding his foal unto the vine, And his ass's colt unto the choice vine; He hath washed his garments in wine, And his vesture in the blood of grapes:"
1,49,12,"His eyes shall be red with wine, And his teeth white with milk."
1,49,13,"Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; And he shall be for a haven of ships; And his border shall be upon Sidon."
1,49,14,"Issachar is a strong ass, Couching down between the sheepfolds:"
1,49,15,"And he saw a resting-place that it was good, And the land that it was pleasant; And he bowed his shoulder to bear, And became a servant under taskwork."
1,49,16,"Dan shall judge his people, As one of the tribes of Israel."
1,49,17,"Dan shall be a serpent in the way, An adder in the path, That biteth the horse's heels, So that his rider falleth backward."
1,49,18,"I have waited for thy salvation, O Jehovah."
1,49,19,"Gad, a troop shall press upon him; But he shall press upon their heel."
1,49,20,"Out of the Asher his bread shall be fat, And he shall yield royal dainties."
1,49,21,"Naphtali is a hind let loose: He giveth goodly words."
1,49,22,"Joseph is a fruitful bough, A fruitful bough by a fountain; His branches run over the wall."
1,49,23,"The archers have sorely grieved him, And shot at him, and persecute him:"
1,49,24,"But his bow abode in strength, And the arms of his hands were made strong, By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, (From thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel),"
1,49,25,"Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee, And by the Almighty, who shall bless thee, With blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that coucheth beneath, Blessings of the breasts, and of the womb."
1,49,26,"The blessings of thy father Have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors Unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: They shall be on the head of Joseph, And on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren."
1,49,27,"Benjamin is a wolf that raveneth: In the morning she shall devour the prey, And at even he shall divide the spoil."
1,49,28,"All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them."
1,49,29,"And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,"
1,49,30,"in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burying-place."
1,49,31,"there they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah:"
1,49,32,"the field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children of Heth."
1,49,33,"And when Jacob made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people."
1,50,1,"And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him."
1,50,2,"And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel."
1,50,3,"And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of embalming: and the Egyptians wept for him three-score and ten days."
1,50,4,"And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found favor in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,"
1,50,5,"My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again."
1,50,6,"And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear."
1,50,7,"And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,"
1,50,8,"and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen."
1,50,9,"And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company."
1,50,10,"And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great and sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days."
1,50,11,"And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan."
1,50,12,"And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:"
1,50,13,"for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, for a possession of a burying-place, of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre."
1,50,14,"And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father."
1,50,15,"And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully requite us all the evil which we did unto him."
1,50,16,"And they sent a message unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,"
1,50,17,"So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the transgression of thy brethren, and their sin, for that they did unto thee evil. And now, we pray thee, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him."
1,50,18,"And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we are thy servants."
1,50,19,"And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?"
1,50,20,"And as for you, ye meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive."
1,50,21,"Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them."
1,50,22,"And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years."
1,50,23,"And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born upon Joseph's knees."
1,50,24,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die; but God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."
1,50,25,"And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence."
1,50,26,"So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt."
2,1,1,"Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt (every man and his household came with Jacob):"
2,1,2,"Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,"
2,1,3,"Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,"
2,1,4,"Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher."
2,1,5,"And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: and Joseph was in Egypt already."
2,1,6,"And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation."
2,1,7,"And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them."
2,1,8,"Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph."
2,1,9,"And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:"
2,1,10,"come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they also join themselves unto our enemies, and fight against us, and get them up out of the land."
2,1,11,"Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh store-cities, Pithom and Raamses."
2,1,12,"But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel."
2,1,13,"And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor:"
2,1,14,"and they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field, all their service, wherein they made them serve with rigor."
2,1,15,"And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:"
2,1,16,"and he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the birth-stool; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him; but if it be a daughter, then she shall live."
2,1,17,"But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men-children alive."
2,1,18,"And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men-children alive?"
2,1,19,"And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwife come unto them."
2,1,20,"And God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty."
2,1,21,"And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them households."
2,1,22,"And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive."
2,2,1,"And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi."
2,2,2,"And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months."
2,2,3,"And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch; and she put the child therein, and laid it in the flags by the river's brink."
2,2,4,"And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him."
2,2,5,"And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river-side; and she saw the ark among the flags, and sent her handmaid to fetch it."
2,2,6,"And she opened it, and saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children."
2,2,7,"Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?"
2,2,8,"And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maiden went and called the child's mother."
2,2,9,"And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it."
2,2,10,"And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water."
2,2,11,"And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren."
2,2,12,"And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand."
2,2,13,"And he went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews were striving together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?"
2,2,14,"And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? Thinkest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known."
2,2,15,"Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well."
2,2,16,"Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock."
2,2,17,"And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock."
2,2,18,"And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to-day?"
2,2,19,"And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock."
2,2,20,"And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? Why is it that ye have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread."
2,2,21,"And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter."
2,2,22,"And she bare a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land."
2,2,23,"And it came to pass in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage."
2,2,24,"And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob."
2,2,25,"And God saw the children of Israel, and God took knowledge `of them'."
2,3,1,"Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to the mountain of God, unto Horeb."
2,3,2,"And the angel of Jehovah appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed."
2,3,3,"And Moses said, I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt."
2,3,4,"And when Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I."
2,3,5,"And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground."
2,3,6,"Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God."
2,3,7,"And Jehovah said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people that are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;"
2,3,8,"and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite."
2,3,9,"And now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: moreover I have seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them."
2,3,10,"Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt."
2,3,11,"And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?"
2,3,12,"And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be the token unto thee, that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain."
2,3,13,"And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? What shall I say unto them?"
2,3,14,"And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you."
2,3,15,"And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name forever, and this is my memorial unto all generations."
2,3,16,"Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, hath appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and `seen' that which is done to you in Egypt:"
2,3,17,"and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, unto a land flowing with milk and honey."
2,3,18,"And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, hath met with us: and now let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God."
2,3,19,"And I know that the king of Egypt will not give you leave to go, no, not by a mighty hand."
2,3,20,"And I will put forth my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go."
2,3,21,"And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty."
2,3,22,"But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall despoil the Egyptians."
2,4,1,"And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice; for they will say, Jehovah hath not appeared unto thee."
2,4,2,"And Jehovah said unto him, What is that in thy hand? And he said, A rod."
2,4,3,"And he said, Cast in on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it."
2,4,4,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Put forth thy hand, and take it by the tail: (and he put forth his hand, and laid hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand:)"
2,4,5,"That they may believe that Jehovah, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee."
2,4,6,"And Jehovah said furthermore unto him, Put now thy hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as `white as' snow."
2,4,7,"And he said, Put thy hand into thy bosom again. (And he put his hand into his bosom again; and when he took it out of his bosom, behold, it was turned again as his `other' flesh.)"
2,4,8,"And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign."
2,4,9,"And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe even these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land."
2,4,10,"And Moses said unto Jehovah, Oh, Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant; for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue."
2,4,11,"And Jehovah said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? Or who maketh `a man' dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, Jehovah?"
2,4,12,"Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt speak."
2,4,13,"And he said, Oh, Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send."
2,4,14,"And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is there not Aaron thy brother the Levite? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart."
2,4,15,"And thou shalt speak unto him, and put the words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do."
2,4,16,"And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people; and it shall come to pass, that he shall be to thee a mouth, and thou shalt be to him as God."
2,4,17,"And thou shalt take in thy hand this rod, wherewith thou shalt do the signs."
2,4,18,"And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren that are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace."
2,4,19,"And Jehovah said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt; for all the men are dead that sought thy life."
2,4,20,"And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand."
2,4,21,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, When thou goest back into Egypt, see that thou do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in thy hand: but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go."
2,4,22,"And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah, Israel is my son, my first-born:"
2,4,23,"and I have said unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me; and thou hast refused to let him go: behold, I will slay thy son, thy first-born."
2,4,24,"And it came to pass on the way at the lodging-place, that Jehovah met him, and sought to kill him."
2,4,25,"Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said, Surely a bridegroom of blood art thou to me."
2,4,26,"So he let him alone. Then she said, A bridegroom of blood `art thou', because of the circumcision."
2,4,27,"And Jehovah said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mountain of God, and kissed him."
2,4,28,"And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah wherewith he had sent him, and all the signs wherewith he had charged him."
2,4,29,"And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:"
2,4,30,"and Aaron spake all the words which Jehovah had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people."
2,4,31,"And the people believed: and when they heard that Jehovah had visited the children of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped."
2,5,1,"And afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said unto Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness."
2,5,2,"And Pharaoh said, Who is Jehovah, that I should hearken unto his voice to let Israel go? I know not Jehovah, and moreover I will not let Israel go."
2,5,3,"And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice unto Jehovah our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword."
2,5,4,"And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, loose the people from their works? get you unto your burdens."
2,5,5,"And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land are now many, and ye make them rest from their burdens."
2,5,6,"And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,"
2,5,7,"Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves."
2,5,8,"And the number of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof: for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God."
2,5,9,"Let heavier work be laid upon the men, that they may labor therein; and let them not regard lying words."
2,5,10,"And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw."
2,5,11,"Go yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it: for nought of your work shall be diminished."
2,5,12,"So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw."
2,5,13,"And the taskmasters were urgent saying, Fulfil your works, `your' daily tasks, as when there was straw."
2,5,14,"And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task both yesterday and to-day, in making brick as heretofore?"
2,5,15,"Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?"
2,5,16,"There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault it in thine own people."
2,5,17,"But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and sacrifice to Jehovah."
2,5,18,"Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the number of bricks."
2,5,19,"And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, when it was said, Ye shall not diminish aught from your bricks, `your' daily tasks."
2,5,20,"And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:"
2,5,21,"and they said unto them, Jehovah look upon you, and judge: because ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us."
2,5,22,"And Moses returned unto Jehovah, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou dealt ill with this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?"
2,5,23,"For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath dealt ill with this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all."
2,6,1,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for by a strong hand shall he let them go, and by a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land."
2,6,2,"And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am Jehovah:"
2,6,3,"and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty; but by my name Jehovah I was not known to them."
2,6,4,"And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, wherein they sojourned."
2,6,5,"And moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant."
2,6,6,"Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am Jehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments:"
2,6,7,"and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God, who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians."
2,6,8,"And I will bring you in unto the land which I sware to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for a heritage: I am Jehovah."
2,6,9,"And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage."
2,6,10,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
2,6,11,"Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land."
2,6,12,"And Moses spake before Jehovah, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?"
2,6,13,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt."
2,6,14,"These are the heads of their fathers' houses. The sons of Reuben the first-born of Israel: Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben."
2,6,15,"And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman; these are the families of Simeon."
2,6,16,"And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari; and the years of the life of Levi were a hundred thirty and seven years."
2,6,17,"The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, according to their families."
2,6,18,"And the sons of Kohath: Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel; and the years of the life of Kohath were a hundred thirty and three years."
2,6,19,"And the sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations."
2,6,20,"And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty and seven years."
2,6,21,"And the sons of Izhar: Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri."
2,6,22,"And the sons of Uzziel: Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Sithri."
2,6,23,"And Aaron took him Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar."
2,6,24,"And the sons of Korah: Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites."
2,6,25,"And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers' `houses' of the Levites according to their families."
2,6,26,"These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom Jehovah said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts."
2,6,27,"These are they that spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron."
2,6,28,"And it came to pass on the day when Jehovah spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt,"
2,6,29,"that Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, I am Jehovah: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak unto thee."
2,6,30,"And Moses said before Jehovah, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?"
2,7,1,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, See, I have made thee as God to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet."
2,7,2,"Thou shalt speak all that I command thee; and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land."
2,7,3,"And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt."
2,7,4,"But Pharaoh will not hearken unto you, and I will lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth my hosts, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments."
2,7,5,"And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them."
2,7,6,"And Moses and Aaron did so; as Jehovah commanded them, so did they."
2,7,7,"And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh."
2,7,8,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,"
2,7,9,"When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Show a wonder for you; then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it become a serpent."
2,7,10,"And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so, as Jehovah had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent."
2,7,11,"Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers: and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did in like manner with their enchantments."
2,7,12,"For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods."
2,7,13,"And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as Jehovah had spoken."
2,7,14,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is stubborn, he refuseth to let the people go."
2,7,15,"Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink to meet him; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thy hand."
2,7,16,"And thou shalt say unto him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou hast not hearkened."
2,7,17,"Thus saith Jehovah, In this thou shalt know that I am Jehovah: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in my hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood."
2,7,18,"And the fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall become foul; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river."
2,7,19,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and over all their ponds of water, that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone."
2,7,20,"And Moses and Aaron did so, as Jehovah commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood."
2,7,21,"And the fish that were in the river died; and the river became foul, and the Egyptians could not drink water from the river; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt."
2,7,22,"And the magicians of Egypt did in like manner with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as Jehovah had spoken."
2,7,23,"And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he lay even this to heart."
2,7,24,"And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river."
2,7,25,"And seven days were fulfilled, after that Jehovah had smitten the river."
2,8,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Let my people go, that they may serve me."
2,8,2,"And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:"
2,8,3,"and the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come into thy house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneading-troughs:"
2,8,4,"and the frogs shall come up both upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants."
2,8,5,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt."
2,8,6,"And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt."
2,8,7,"And the magicians did in like manner with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt."
2,8,8,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat Jehovah, that he take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice unto Jehovah."
2,8,9,"And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Have thou this glory over me: against what time shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, that the frogs be destroyed from thee and thy houses, and remain in the river only?"
2,8,10,"And he said, Against to-morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like unto Jehovah our God."
2,8,11,"And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only."
2,8,12,"And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto Jehovah concerning the frogs which he had brought upon Pharaoh."
2,8,13,"And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields."
2,8,14,"And they gathered them together in heaps; and the land stank."
2,8,15,"But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them, as Jehovah had spoken."
2,8,16,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the earth, that is may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt."
2,8,17,"And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and there were lice upon man, and upon beast; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt."
2,8,18,"And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: and there were lice upon man, and upon beast."
2,8,19,"Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as Jehovah had spoken."
2,8,20,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Let my people go, that they may serve me."
2,8,21,"Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon they servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are."
2,8,22,"And I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am Jehovah in the midst of the earth."
2,8,23,"And I will put a division between my people and thy people: by to-morrow shall this sign be."
2,8,24,"And Jehovah did so; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses: and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarms of flies."
2,8,25,"And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land."
2,8,26,"And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Jehovah our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?"
2,8,27,"We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Jehovah our God, as he shall command us."
2,8,28,"And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to Jehovah your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: entreat for me."
2,8,29,"And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat Jehovah that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to-morrow: only let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Jehovah."
2,8,30,"And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Jehovah."
2,8,31,"And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one."
2,8,32,"And Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go."
2,9,1,"Then Jehovah said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me."
2,9,2,"For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,"
2,9,3,"behold, the hand of Jehovah is upon thy cattle which are in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the herds, and upon the flocks: `there shall be' a very grievous murrain."
2,9,4,"And Jehovah shall make a distinction between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt; and there shall nothing die of all that belongeth to the children of Israel."
2,9,5,"And Jehovah appointed a set time, saying, To-morrow Jehovah shall do this thing in the land."
2,9,6,"And Jehovah did that thing on the morrow; and all the cattle of Egypt died; but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one."
2,9,7,"And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he did not let the people go."
2,9,8,"And Jehovah said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh."
2,9,9,"And it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt."
2,9,10,"And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast."
2,9,11,"And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians."
2,9,12,"And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them, as Jehovah had spoken unto Moses."
2,9,13,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me."
2,9,14,"For I will this time send all my plagues upon thy heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth."
2,9,15,"For now I had put forth my hand, and smitten thee and thy people with pestilence, and thou hadst been cut off from the earth:"
2,9,16,"but in very deed for this cause have I made thee to stand, to show thee my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth."
2,9,17,"As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?"
2,9,18,"Behold, to-morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now."
2,9,19,"Now therefore send, hasten in thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field; `for' every man and beast that shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die."
2,9,20,"He that feared the word of Jehovah among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses."
2,9,21,"And he that regarded not the word of Jehovah left his servants and his cattle in the field."
2,9,22,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch forth thy hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt."
2,9,23,"And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and Jehovah sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down unto the earth; and Jehovah rained hail upon the land of Egypt."
2,9,24,"So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation."
2,9,25,"And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field."
2,9,26,"Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail."
2,9,27,"And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: Jehovah is righteous, and I and my people are wicked."
2,9,28,"Entreat Jehovah; for there hath been enough of `these' mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer."
2,9,29,"And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto Jehovah; the thunders shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know that the earth is Jehovah's."
2,9,30,"But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear Jehovah God."
2,9,31,"And the flax and the barley were smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom."
2,9,32,"But the wheat and the spelt were not smitten: for they were not grown up."
2,9,33,"And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto Jehovah: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth."
2,9,34,"And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants."
2,9,35,"And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the children of Israel go, as Jehovah had spoken by Moses."
2,10,1,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I may show these my signs in the midst of them,"
2,10,2,"and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought upon Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know that I am Jehovah."
2,10,3,"And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me."
2,10,4,"Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to-morrow will I bring locusts into thy border:"
2,10,5,"and they shall cover the face of the earth, so that one shall not be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:"
2,10,6,"and thy houses shall be filled, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; as neither thy fathers nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned, and went out from Pharaoh."
2,10,7,"And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve Jehovah their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?"
2,10,8,"And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve Jehovah your God; but who are they that shall go?"
2,10,9,"And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old; with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto Jehovah."
2,10,10,"And he said unto them, So be Jehovah with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you."
2,10,11,"Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve Jehovah; for that is what ye desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence."
2,10,12,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left."
2,10,13,"And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts."
2,10,14,"And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt; very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such."
2,10,15,"For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt."
2,10,16,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against Jehovah your God, and against you."
2,10,17,"Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat Jehovah your God, that he may take away from me this death only."
2,10,18,"And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Jehovah."
2,10,19,"And Jehovah turned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea; there remained not one locust in all the border of Egypt."
2,10,20,"But Jehovah hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go."
2,10,21,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt."
2,10,22,"And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days;"
2,10,23,"they saw not one another, neither rose any one from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings."
2,10,24,"And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve Jehovah; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you."
2,10,25,"And Moses said, Thou must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt-offerings, that we may sacrifice unto Jehovah our God."
2,10,26,"Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not a hoof be left behind: for thereof must we take to serve Jehovah our God; and we know not with what we must serve Jehovah, until we come thither."
2,10,27,"But Jehovah hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go."
2,10,28,"And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in the day thou seest my face thou shalt die."
2,10,29,"And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well. I will see thy face again no more."
2,11,1,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Yet one plague more will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether."
2,11,2,"Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every man of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold."
2,11,3,"And Jehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people."
2,11,4,"And Moses said, Thus saith Jehovah, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:"
2,11,5,"and all the first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill; and all the first-born of cattle."
2,11,6,"And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there hath not been, nor shall be any more."
2,11,7,"But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that Jehovah doth make a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel."
2,11,8,"And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger."
2,11,9,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pharaoh will not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt."
2,11,10,"And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and Jehovah hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go out of his land."
2,12,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,"
2,12,2,"This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you."
2,12,3,"Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth `day' of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers' houses, a lamb for a household:"
2,12,4,"and if the household be too little for a lamb, then shall he and his neighbor next unto his house take one according to the number of the souls; according to every man's eating ye shall make your count for the lamb."
2,12,5,"Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old: ye shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats:"
2,12,6,"and ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at even."
2,12,7,"And they shall take of the blood, and put it on the two side-posts and on the lintel, upon the houses wherein they shall eat it."
2,12,8,"And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; with bitter herbs they shall eat it."
2,12,9,"Eat not of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roast with fire; its head with its legs and with the inwards thereof."
2,12,10,"And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; but that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire."
2,12,11,"And thus shall ye eat it: with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is Jehovah's passover."
2,12,12,"For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will smite all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am Jehovah."
2,12,13,"And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there shall no plague be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt."
2,12,14,"And this day shall be unto you for a memorial, and ye shall keep it a feast to Jehovah: throughout your generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever."
2,12,15,"Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel."
2,12,16,"And in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you."
2,12,17,"And ye shall observe the `feast of' unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance for ever."
2,12,18,"In the first `month', on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even."
2,12,19,"Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a sojourner, or one that is born in the land."
2,12,20,"Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread."
2,12,21,"Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out, and take you lambs according to your families, and kill the passover."
2,12,22,"And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side-posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning."
2,12,23,"For Jehovah will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side-posts, Jehovah will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you."
2,12,24,"And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever."
2,12,25,"And it shall come to pass, when ye are come to the land which Jehovah will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service."
2,12,26,"And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?"
2,12,27,"that ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of Jehovah's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped."
2,12,28,"And the children of Israel went and did so; as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they."
2,12,29,"And it came to pass at midnight, that Jehovah smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the first-born of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the first-born of cattle."
2,12,30,"And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead."
2,12,31,"And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve Jehovah, as ye have said."
2,12,32,"Take both your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also."
2,12,33,"And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, to send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We are all dead men."
2,12,34,"And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading-troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders."
2,12,35,"And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment."
2,12,36,"And Jehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. And they despoiled the Egyptians."
2,12,37,"And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, besides children."
2,12,38,"And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle."
2,12,39,"And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt; for it was not leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victuals."
2,12,40,"Now the time that the children of Israel dwelt in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years."
2,12,41,"And it came to pass at the end of four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of Jehovah went out from the land of Egypt."
2,12,42,"It is a night to be much observed unto Jehovah for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of Jehovah, to be much observed of all the children of Israel throughout their generations."
2,12,43,"And Jehovah said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: there shall no foreigner eat thereof;"
2,12,44,"but every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof."
2,12,45,"A sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat thereof."
2,12,46,"In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof."
2,12,47,"All the congregation of Israel shall keep it."
2,12,48,"And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to Jehovah, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: but no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof."
2,12,49,"One law shall be to him that is home-born, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you."
2,12,50,"Thus did all the children of Israel; as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they."
2,12,51,"And it came to pass the selfsame day, that Jehovah did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts."
2,13,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
2,13,2,"Sanctify unto me all the first-born, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine."
2,13,3,"And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand Jehovah brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten."
2,13,4,"This day ye go forth in the month Abib."
2,13,5,"And it shall be, when Jehovah shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month."
2,13,6,"Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to Jehovah."
2,13,7,"Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee, in all thy borders."
2,13,8,"And thou shalt tell thy son in that day, saying, It is because of that which Jehovah did for me when I came forth out of Egypt."
2,13,9,"And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the law of Jehovah may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath Jehovah brought thee out of Egypt."
2,13,10,"Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year."
2,13,11,"And it shall be, when Jehovah shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanite, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee,"
2,13,12,"that thou shalt set apart unto Jehovah all that openeth the womb, and every firstling which thou hast that cometh of a beast; the males shall be Jehovah's."
2,13,13,"And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck: and all the first-born of man among thy sons shalt thou redeem."
2,13,14,"And it shall be, when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand Jehovah brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:"
2,13,15,"and it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that Jehovah slew all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both the first-born of man, and the first-born of beast: therefore I sacrifice to Jehovah all that openeth the womb, being males; but all the first-born of my sons I redeem."
2,13,16,"And it shall be for a sign upon thy hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand Jehovah brought us forth out of Egypt."
2,13,17,"And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:"
2,13,18,"but God led the people about, by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea: and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt."
2,13,19,"And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you."
2,13,20,"And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness."
2,13,21,"And Jehovah went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light, that they might go by day and by night:"
2,13,22,"the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, departed not from before the people."
2,14,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
2,14,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-zephon: over against it shall ye encamp by the sea."
2,14,3,"And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in."
2,14,4,"And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he shall follow after them; and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host: and the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah. And they did so."
2,14,5,"And it was told the king of Egypt that the people were fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed towards the people, and they said, What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?"
2,14,6,"And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:"
2,14,7,"and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them."
2,14,8,"And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: for the children of Israel went out with a high hand."
2,14,9,"And the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses `and' chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal-zephon."
2,14,10,"And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians were marching after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto Jehovah."
2,14,11,"And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to bring us forth out of Egypt?"
2,14,12,"Is not this the word that we spake unto thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness."
2,14,13,"And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of Jehovah, which he will work for you to-day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to-day, ye shall see them again no more for ever."
2,14,14,"Jehovah will fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace."
2,14,15,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward."
2,14,16,"And lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground."
2,14,17,"And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall go in after them: and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen."
2,14,18,"And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have gotten me honor upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen."
2,14,19,"And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud removed from before them, and stood behind them:"
2,14,20,"and it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud and the darkness, yet gave it light by night: and the one came not near the other all the night."
2,14,21,"And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and Jehovah caused the sea to go `back' by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided."
2,14,22,"And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left."
2,14,23,"And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen."
2,14,24,"And it came to pass in the morning watch, that Jehovah looked forth upon the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and discomfited the host of the Egyptians."
2,14,25,"And he took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them heavily; so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for Jehovah fighteth for them against the Egyptians."
2,14,26,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen."
2,14,27,"And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and Jehovah overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea."
2,14,28,"And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, even all the host of Pharaoh that went in after them into the sea; there remained not so much as one of them."
2,14,29,"But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left."
2,14,30,"Thus Jehovah saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea-shore."
2,14,31,"And Israel saw the great work which Jehovah did upon the Egyptians, and the people feared Jehovah: and they believed in Jehovah, and in his servant Moses."
2,15,1,"Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto Jehovah, and spake, saying, I will sing unto Jehovah, for he hath triumphed gloriously: The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea."
2,15,2,"Jehovah is my strength and song, And he is become my salvation: This is my God, and I will praise him; My father's God, and I will exalt him."
2,15,3,"Jehovah is a man of war: Jehovah is his name."
2,15,4,"Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea; And his chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea."
2,15,5,"The deeps cover them: They went down into the depths like a stone."
2,15,6,"Thy right hand, O Jehovah, is glorious in power, Thy right hand, O Jehovah, dasheth in pieces the enemy."
2,15,7,"And in the greatness of thine excellency thou overthrowest them that rise up against thee: Thou sendest forth thy wrath, it consumeth them as stubble."
2,15,8,"And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were piled up, The floods stood upright as a heap; The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea."
2,15,9,"The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; My desire shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them."
2,15,10,"Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: They sank as lead in the mighty waters."
2,15,11,"Who is like unto thee, O Jehovah, among the gods? Who is like thee, glorious in holiness, Fearful in praises, doing wonders?"
2,15,12,"Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, The earth swallowed them."
2,15,13,"Thou in thy lovingkindness hast led the people that thou hast redeemed: Thou hast guided them in thy strength to thy holy habitation."
2,15,14,"The peoples have heard, they tremble: Pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia."
2,15,15,"Then were the chiefs of Edom dismayed; The mighty men of Moab, trembling taketh hold upon them: All the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away."
2,15,16,"Terror and dread falleth upon them; By the greatness of thine arm they are as still as a stone; Till thy people pass over, O Jehovah, Till the people pass over that thou hast purchased."
2,15,17,"Thou wilt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, The place, O Jehovah, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, The sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established."
2,15,18,"Jehovah shall reign for ever and ever."
2,15,19,"For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and Jehovah brought back the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea."
2,15,20,"And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances."
2,15,21,"And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to Jehovah, for he hath triumphed gloriously; The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea."
2,15,22,"And Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water."
2,15,23,"And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah."
2,15,24,"And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?"
2,15,25,"An he cried unto Jehovah; And Jehovah showed him a tree, and he cast it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them;"
2,15,26,"and he said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his eyes, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases upon thee, which I have put upon the Egyptians: for I am Jehovah that healeth thee."
2,15,27,"And they came to Elim, where were twelve springs of water, and threescore and ten palm-trees: and they encamped there by the waters."
2,16,1,"And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt."
2,16,2,"And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness:"
2,16,3,"and the children of Israel said unto them, Would that we had died by the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh-pots, when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger."
2,16,4,"Then said Jehovah unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or not."
2,16,5,"And it shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily."
2,16,6,"And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that Jehovah hath brought you out from the land of Egypt;"
2,16,7,"and in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of Jehovah; for that he heareth your murmurings against Jehovah: and what are we, that ye murmur against us?"
2,16,8,"And Moses said, `This shall be', when Jehovah shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that Jehovah heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against Jehovah."
2,16,9,"And Moses said unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before Jehovah; for he hath heard your murmurings."
2,16,10,"And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of Jehovah appeared in the cloud."
2,16,11,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
2,16,12,"I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God."
2,16,13,"And it came to pass at even, that the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the camp."
2,16,14,"And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness a small round thing, small as the hoar-frost on the ground."
2,16,15,"And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, What is it? For they knew not what it was. And Moses said unto them, It is the bread which Jehovah hath given you to eat."
2,16,16,"This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, Gather ye of it every man according to his eating; an omer a head, according to the number of your persons, shall ye take it, every man for them that are in his tent."
2,16,17,"And the children of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less."
2,16,18,"And when they measured it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating."
2,16,19,"And Moses said unto them, Let no man leave of it till the morning."
2,16,20,"Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became foul: and Moses was wroth with them."
2,16,21,"And they gathered it morning by morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted."
2,16,22,"And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses."
2,16,23,"And he said unto them, This is that which Jehovah hath spoken, Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy sabbath unto Jehovah: bake that which ye will bake, and boil that which ye will boil; and all that remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning."
2,16,24,"And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not become foul, neither was there any worm therein."
2,16,25,"And Moses said, Eat that to-day; for to-day is a sabbath unto Jehovah: to-day ye shall not find it in the field."
2,16,26,"Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day is the sabbath, in it there shall be none."
2,16,27,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that there went out some of the people to gather, and they found none."
2,16,28,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?"
2,16,29,"See, for that Jehovah hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day."
2,16,30,"So the people rested on the seventh day."
2,16,31,"And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers `made' with honey."
2,16,32,"And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread wherewith I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt."
2,16,33,"And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omerful of manna therein, and lay it up before Jehovah, to be kept throughout your generations."
2,16,34,"As Jehovah commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept."
2,16,35,"And the children of Israel did eat the manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat the manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan."
2,16,36,"Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah."
2,17,1,"And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, by their journeys, according to the commandment of Jehovah, and encamped in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink."
2,17,2,"Wherefore the people stove with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why strive ye with me? Wherefore do ye tempt Jehovah?"
2,17,3,"And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore hast thou brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?"
2,17,4,"And Moses cried unto Jehovah, saying, What shall I do unto this people? They are almost ready to stone me."
2,17,5,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pass on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and they rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thy hand, and go."
2,17,6,"Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel."
2,17,7,"And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the striving of the children of Israel, and because they tempted Jehovah, saying, Is Jehovah among us, or not?"
2,17,8,"Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim."
2,17,9,"And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to-morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand."
2,17,10,"So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill."
2,17,11,"And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed."
2,17,12,"But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; And his hands were steady until the going down of the sun."
2,17,13,"And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword."
2,17,14,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven."
2,17,15,"And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi;"
2,17,16,"And he said, Jehovah hath sworn: Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation."
2,18,1,"Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, how that Jehovah had brought Israel out of Egypt."
2,18,2,"And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her away,"
2,18,3,"and her two sons; of whom the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land:"
2,18,4,"and the name of the other was Eliezer; for `he said', The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh."
2,18,5,"And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the mount of God:"
2,18,6,"and he said unto Moses, I, thy father-in-law Jethro, am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her."
2,18,7,"And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance, and kissed him: and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent."
2,18,8,"And Moses told his father-in-law all that Jehovah had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how Jehovah delivered them."
2,18,9,"And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which Jehovah had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians."
2,18,10,"And Jethro said, Blessed be Jehovah, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians."
2,18,11,"Now I know that Jehovah is greater than all gods; yea, in the thing wherein they dealt proudly against them."
2,18,12,"And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt-offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God."
2,18,13,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood about Moses from the morning unto the evening."
2,18,14,"And when Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand about thee from morning unto even?"
2,18,15,"And Moses said unto his father-in-law, Because the people come unto me to inquire of God:"
2,18,16,"when they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws."
2,18,17,"And Moses' father-in-law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good."
2,18,18,"Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for the thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone."
2,18,19,"Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God be with thee: be thou for the people to God-ward, and bring thou the causes unto God:"
2,18,20,"and thou shalt teach them the statutes and the laws, and shalt show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do."
2,18,21,"Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:"
2,18,22,"and let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge themselves: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear `the burden' with thee."
2,18,23,"If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people also shall go to their place in peace."
2,18,24,"So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said."
2,18,25,"And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens."
2,18,26,"And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves."
2,18,27,"And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land."
2,19,1,"In the third month after the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai."
2,19,2,"And when they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mount."
2,19,3,"And Moses went up unto God, and Jehovah called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:"
2,19,4,"Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself."
2,19,5,"Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be mine own possession from among all peoples: for all the earth is mine:"
2,19,6,"and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel."
2,19,7,"And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which Jehovah commanded him."
2,19,8,"And all the people answered together, and said, All that Jehovah hath spoken we will do. And Moses reported the words of the people unto Jehovah."
2,19,9,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto Jehovah."
2,19,10,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their garments,"
2,19,11,"and be ready against the third day; for the third day Jehovah will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai."
2,19,12,"And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:"
2,19,13,"no hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, he shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount."
2,19,14,"And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their garments."
2,19,15,"And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not near a woman."
2,19,16,"And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of a trumpet exceeding loud; and all the people that were in the camp trembled."
2,19,17,"And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount."
2,19,18,"And mount Sinai, the whole of it, smoked, because Jehovah descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly."
2,19,19,"And when the voice of the trumpet waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice."
2,19,20,"And Jehovah came down upon mount Sinai, to the top of the mount: and Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mount; and Moses went up."
2,19,21,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto Jehovah to gaze, and many of them perish."
2,19,22,"And let the priests also, that come near to Jehovah, sanctify themselves, lest Jehovah break forth upon them."
2,19,23,"And Moses said unto Jehovah, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou didst charge us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it."
2,19,24,"And Jehovah said unto him, Go, get thee down; and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto Jehovah, lest he break forth upon them."
2,19,25,"So Moses went down unto the people, and told them."
2,20,1,"And God spake all these words, saying,"
2,20,2,"I am Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage."
2,20,3,"Thou shalt have no other gods before me."
2,20,4,"Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor any likeness `of any thing' that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth."
2,20,5,"Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them, for I Jehovah thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate me,"
2,20,6,"and showing lovingkindness unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments."
2,20,7,"Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain; for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain."
2,20,8,"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy."
2,20,9,"Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work;"
2,20,10,"but the seventh day is a sabbath unto Jehovah thy God: `in it' thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:"
2,20,11,"for in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore Jehovah blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it."
2,20,12,"Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee."
2,20,13,"Thou shalt not kill."
2,20,14,"Thou shalt not commit adultery."
2,20,15,"Thou shalt not steal."
2,20,16,"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor."
2,20,17,"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor's."
2,20,18,"And all the people perceived the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the voice of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they trembled, and stood afar off."
2,20,19,"And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear; but let not God speak with us, lest we die."
2,20,20,"And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before you, that ye sin not."
2,20,21,"And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was."
2,20,22,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven."
2,20,23,"Ye shall not make `other gods' with me; gods of silver, or gods of gold, ye shall not make unto you."
2,20,24,"An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in every place where I record my name I will come unto thee and I will bless thee."
2,20,25,"And if thou make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stones; for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it."
2,20,26,"Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not uncovered thereon."
2,21,1,"Now these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them."
2,21,2,"If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing."
2,21,3,"If he come in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he be married, then his wife shall go out with him."
2,21,4,"If his master give him a wife and she bear him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself."
2,21,5,"But if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:"
2,21,6,"then his master shall bring him unto God, and shall bring him to the door, or unto the door-post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever."
2,21,7,"And if a man sell his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not go out as the men-servants do."
2,21,8,"If she please not her master, who hath espoused her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a foreign people he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her."
2,21,9,"And if he espouse her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters."
2,21,10,"If he take him another `wife'; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish."
2,21,11,"And if he do not these three things unto her, then shall she go out for nothing, without money."
2,21,12,"He that smiteth a man, so that he dieth, shall surely be put to death."
2,21,13,"And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver `him' into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee."
2,21,14,"And if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die."
2,21,15,"And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death."
2,21,16,"And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death."
2,21,17,"And he that curseth his father or his mother, shall surely be put to death."
2,21,18,"And if men contend, and one smite the other with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keep his bed;"
2,21,19,"if he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed."
2,21,20,"And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall surely be punished."
2,21,21,"Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money."
2,21,22,"And if men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart, and yet no harm follow; he shall be surely fined, according as the woman's husband shall lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine."
2,21,23,"But if any harm follow, then thou shalt give life for life,"
2,21,24,"eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,"
2,21,25,"burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe."
2,21,26,"And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, and destroy it; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake."
2,21,27,"And if he smite out his man-servant's tooth, or his maid-servant's tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake."
2,21,28,"And if an ox gore a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be surely stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit."
2,21,29,"But if the ox was wont to gore in time past, and it hath been testified to its owner, and he hath not kept it in, but it hath killed a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death."
2,21,30,"If there be laid on him a ransom, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid upon him."
2,21,31,"Whether it have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him."
2,21,32,"If the ox gore a man-servant or a maid-servant, there shall be given unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned."
2,21,33,"And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein,"
2,21,34,"the owner of the pit shall make it good; he shall give money unto the owner thereof, and the dead `beast' shall be his."
2,21,35,"And if one man's ox hurt another's, so that it dieth, then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the price of it: and the dead also they shall divide."
2,21,36,"Or if it be known that the ox was wont to gore in time past, and its owner hath not kept it in, he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead `beast' shall be his own."
2,22,1,"If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep."

2,22,9,"For every matter of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, `or' for any manner of lost thing, whereof one saith, This is it, the cause of both parties shall come before God; he whom God shall condemn shall pay double unto his neighbor."
2,22,10,"If a man deliver unto his neighbor an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:"
2,22,11,"the oath of Jehovah shall be between them both, whether he hath not put his hand unto his neighbor's goods; and the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution."

2,22,25,"If thou lend money to any of my people with thee that is poor, thou shalt not be to him as a creditor; neither shall ye lay upon him interest."
2,22,26,"If thou at all take thy neighbor's garment to pledge, thou shalt restore it unto him before the sun goeth down:"
2,22,27,"for that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? And it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious."
2,22,28,"Thou shalt not revile God, nor curse a ruler of thy people."

2,23,7,"Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked."
2,23,8,"And thou shalt take no bribe: for a bribe blindeth them that have sight, and perverteth the words of the righteous."
2,23,9,"And a sojourner shalt thou not oppress: for ye know the heart of a sojourner, seeing ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt."
2,23,10,"And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the increase thereof:"
2,23,11,"but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie fallow; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beast of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, `and' with thy oliveyard."
2,23,12,"Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest; that thine ox and thine ass may have rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the sojourner, may be refreshed."

2,23,14,"Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year."
2,23,15,"The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep: seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib (for in it thou camest out from Egypt); and none shall appear before me empty:"
2,23,16,"and the feast of harvest, the first-fruits of thy labors, which thou sowest in the field: and the feast of ingathering, at the end of the year, when thou gatherest in thy labors out of the field."
2,23,17,"Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord Jehovah."
2,23,18,"Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my feast remain all night until the morning."
2,23,19,"The first of the first-fruits of thy ground thou shalt bring into the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in it mother's milk."
2,23,20,"Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee by the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared."
2,23,21,"Take ye heed before him, and hearken unto his voice; provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgression: for my name is in him."
2,23,22,"But if thou shalt indeed hearken unto his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries."
2,23,23,"For mine angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: and I will cut them off."
2,23,24,"Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works; but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and break in pieces their pillars."

2,23,28,"And I will send the hornet before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee."
2,23,29,"I will not drive them out from before thee in one year, lest the land become desolate, and the beasts of the field multiply against thee."
2,23,30,"By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land."
2,23,31,"And I will set thy border from the Red Sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness unto the River: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand: and thou shalt drive them out before thee."
2,23,32,"Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods."
2,23,33,"They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me; for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee."
2,24,1,"And he said unto Moses, Come up unto Jehovah, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off:"
2,24,2,"and Moses alone shall come near unto Jehovah; but they shall not come near; neither shall the people go up with him."
2,24,3,"And Moses came and told the people all the words of Jehovah, and all the ordinances: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which Jehovah hath spoken will we do."

2,24,5,"And he sent young men of the children of Israel, who offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings of oxen unto Jehovah."
2,24,6,"And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar."
2,24,7,"And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that Jehovah hath spoken will we do, and be obedient."
2,24,8,"And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which Jehovah hath made with you concerning all these words."
2,24,9,"Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel."
2,24,10,"And they saw the God of Israel; and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of sapphire stone, and as it were the very heaven for clearness."
2,24,11,"And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: and they beheld God, and did eat and drink."
2,24,12,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee the tables of stone, and the law and the commandment, which I have written, that thou mayest teach them."
2,24,13,"And Moses rose up, and Joshua his minister: and Moses went up into the mount of God."

2,24,15,"And Moses went up into the mount, and the cloud covered the mount."
2,24,16,"And the glory of Jehovah abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud."
2,24,17,"And the appearance of the glory of Jehovah was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel."
2,24,18,"And Moses entered into the midst of the cloud, and went up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights."
2,25,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
2,25,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, that they take for me an offering: of every man whose heart maketh him willing ye shall take my offering."
2,25,3,"And this is the offering which ye shall take of them: gold, and silver, and brass,"

2,28,16,"Foursquare it shall be `and' double; a span shall be the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof."
2,28,17,"And thou shalt set in it settings of stones, four rows of stones: a row of sardius, topaz, and carbuncle shall be the first row;"
2,28,18,"and the second row an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond;"
2,28,19,"and the third row a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;"
2,28,20,"and the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper: they shall be inclosed in gold in their settings."
2,28,21,"And the stones shall be according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names; like the engravings of a signet, every one according to his name, they shall be for the twelve tribes."
2,28,22,"And thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains like cords, of wreathen work of pure gold."
2,28,23,"And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold, and shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate."
2,28,24,"And thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings at the ends of the breastplate."
2,28,25,"And the `other' two ends of the two wreathen chains thou shalt put on the two settings, and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod in the forepart thereof."
2,28,26,"And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt put them upon the two ends of the breastplate, upon the edge thereof, which is toward the side of the ephod inward."
2,28,27,"And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and shalt put them on the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod underneath, in the forepart thereof, close by the coupling thereof, above the skilfully woven band of the ephod."
2,28,28,"And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be upon the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate be not loosed from the ephod."
2,28,29,"And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in unto the holy place, for a memorial before Jehovah continually."
2,28,30,"And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron's heart, when he goeth in before Jehovah: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before Jehovah continually."
2,28,31,"And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue."
2,28,32,"And it shall have a hole for the head in the midst thereof: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it, as it were the hole of a coat of mail, that it be not rent."
2,28,33,"And upon the skirts of it thou shalt make pomegranates of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the skirts thereof; and bells of gold between them round about:"
2,28,34,"a golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe round about."
2,28,35,"And it shall be upon Aaron to minister: and the sound thereof shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before Jehovah, and when he cometh out, that he die not."
2,28,36,"And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it, like the engravings of a signet, HOLY TO JEHOVAH."
2,28,37,"And thou shalt put it on a lace of blue, and it shall be upon the mitre; upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be."
2,28,38,"And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead, and Aaron shall bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before Jehovah."
2,28,39,"And thou shalt weave the coat in checker work of fine linen, and thou shalt make a mitre of fine linen, and thou shalt make a girdle, the work of the embroiderer."
2,28,40,"And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt make for them girdles, and head-tires shalt thou make for them, for glory and for beauty."
2,28,41,"And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and upon his sons with him, and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office."
2,28,42,"And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover the flesh of their nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach:"
2,28,43,"And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they go in unto the tent of meeting, or when they come near unto the altar to minister in the holy place; that they bear not iniquity, and die: it shall be a statute for ever unto him and unto his seed after him."
2,29,1,"And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, to minister unto me in the priest's office: take one young bullock and two rams without blemish,"
2,29,2,"and unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened mingled with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of fine wheaten flour shalt thou make them."
2,29,3,"And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams."
2,29,4,"And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tent of meeting, and shalt wash them with water."
2,29,5,"And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the skilfully woven band of the ephod;"
2,29,6,"and thou shalt set the mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the mitre."
2,29,7,"Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his head, and anoint him."
2,29,8,"And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them."
2,29,9,"And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and bind head-tires on them: and they shall have the priesthood by a perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons."
2,29,10,"And thou shalt bring the bullock before the tent of meeting: and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock."
2,29,11,"And thou shalt kill the bullock before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of meeting."
2,29,12,"And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger; and thou shalt pour out all the blood at the base of the altar."
2,29,13,"And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul upon the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar."
2,29,14,"But the flesh of the bullock, and its skin, and it dung, shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin-offering."
2,29,15,"Thou shalt also take the one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram."
2,29,16,"And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take its blood, and sprinkle it round about upon the altar."
2,29,17,"And thou shalt cut the ram into its pieces, and wash its inwards, and its legs, and put them with its pieces, and with its head."
2,29,18,"And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt-offering unto Jehovah; it is a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah."
2,29,19,"And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram."
2,29,20,"Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of its blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about."
2,29,21,"And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him."
2,29,22,"Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat, and the fat tail, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right thigh (for it is a ram of consecration),"
2,29,23,"and one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, out of the basket of unleavened bread that is before Jehovah."
2,29,24,"And thou shalt put the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and shalt wave them for a wave-offering before Jehovah."
2,29,25,"And thou shalt take them from their hands, and burn them on the altar upon the burnt-offering, for a sweet savor before Jehovah: it is an offering made by fire unto Jehovah."
2,29,26,"And thou shalt take the breast of Aaron's ram of consecration, and wave it for a wave-offering before Jehovah: and it shall be thy portion."
2,29,27,"And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave-offering, and the thigh of the heave-offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons:"
2,29,28,"and it shall be for Aaron and his sons as `their' portion for ever from the children of Israel; for it is a heave-offering: and it shall be a heave-offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, even their heave-offering unto Jehovah."
2,29,29,"And the holy garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him, to be anointed in them, and to be consecrated in them."
2,29,30,"Seven days shall the son that is priest in his stead put them on, when he cometh into the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place."
2,29,31,"And thou shalt take the ram of consecration, and boil its flesh in a holy place."
2,29,32,"And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, at the door of the tent of meeting."
2,29,33,"And they shall eat those things wherewith atonement was made, to consecrate `and' to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy."
2,29,34,"And if aught of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy."
2,29,35,"And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them."
2,29,36,"And every day shalt thou offer the bullock of sin-offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou makest atonement for it; and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it."
2,29,37,"Seven days thou shalt make atonement for the altar, and sanctify it: and the altar shall be most holy; whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy."
2,29,38,"Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar: two lambs a year old day by day continually."
2,29,39,"The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even:"
2,29,40,"and with the one lamb a tenth part `of an ephah' of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil, and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink-offering."
2,29,41,"And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meal-offering of the morning, and according to the drink-offering thereof, for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah."
2,29,42,"It shall be a continual burnt-offering throughout your generations at the door of the tent of meeting before Jehovah, where I will meet with you, to speak there unto thee."
2,29,43,"And there I will meet with the children of Israel; and `the Tent' shall be sanctified by my glory."
2,29,44,"And I will sanctify the tent of meeting, and the altar: Aaron also and his sons will I sanctify, to minister to me in the priest's office."
2,29,45,"And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God."
2,29,46,"And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I might dwell among them: I am Jehovah their God."
2,30,1,"And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of acacia wood shalt thou make it."
2,30,2,"A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be; and two cubits shall be the height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of one piece with it."
2,30,3,"And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about."
2,30,4,"And two golden rings shalt thou make for it under the crown thereof; upon the two ribs thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make them; and they shall be for places for staves wherewith to bear it."
2,30,5,"And thou shalt make the staves of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold."
2,30,6,"And thou shalt put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy-seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee."
2,30,7,"And Aaron shall burn thereon incense of sweet spices: every morning, when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn it."
2,30,8,"And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before Jehovah throughout your generations."
2,30,9,"Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt-offering, nor meal-offering; and ye shall pour no drink-offering thereon."
2,30,10,"And Aaron shall make atonement upon the horns of it once in the year; with the blood of the sin-offering of atonement once in the year shall he make atonement for it throughout your generations: it is most holy unto Jehovah."
2,30,11,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
2,30,12,"When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel, according to those that are numbered of them, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto Jehovah, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them."
2,30,13,"This they shall give, every one that passeth over unto them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary; (the shekel is twenty gerahs;) half a shekel for an offering to Jehovah."
2,30,14,"Every one that passeth over unto them that are numbered, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the offering of Jehovah."
2,30,15,"The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than the half shekel, when they give the offering of Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls."
2,30,16,"And thou shalt take the atonement money from the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tent of meeting; that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls."
2,30,17,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
2,30,18,"Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and the base thereof of brass, whereat to wash. And thou shalt put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein."
2,30,19,"And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:"
2,30,20,"when they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn an offering made by fire unto Jehovah."
2,30,21,"So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations."
2,30,22,"Moreover Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
2,30,23,"Take thou also unto thee the chief spices: of flowing myrrh five hundred `shekels', and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty,"
2,30,24,"and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a hin."
2,30,25,"And thou shalt make it a holy anointing oil, a perfume compounded after the art of the perfumer: it shall be a holy anointing oil."
2,30,26,"And thou shalt anoint therewith the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony,"
2,30,27,"and the table and all the vessels thereof, and the candlestick and the vessels thereof, and the altar of incense,"
2,30,28,"and the altar of burnt-offering with all the vessels thereof, and the laver and the base thereof."
2,30,29,"And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy."
2,30,30,"And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office."
2,30,31,"And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be a holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations."
2,30,32,"Upon the flesh of man shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any like it, according to the composition thereof: it is holy, `and' it shall be holy unto you."
2,30,33,"Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people."
2,30,34,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight;"
2,30,35,"and thou shalt make of it incense, a perfume after the art of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure `and' holy:"
2,30,36,"and thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy."
2,30,37,"And the incense which thou shalt make, according to the composition thereof ye shall not make for yourselves: it shall be unto thee holy for Jehovah."
2,30,38,"Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereof, he shall be cut off from his people."
2,31,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
2,31,2,"See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:"
2,31,3,"and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,"
2,31,4,"to devise skilful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,"
2,31,5,"and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of workmanship."
2,31,6,"And I, behold, I have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all that are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee:"
2,31,7,"the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy-seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the Tent,"
2,31,8,"and the table and its vessels, and the pure candlestick with all its vessels, and the altar of incense,"
2,31,9,"and the altar of burnt-offering with all its vessels, and the laver and its base,"
2,31,10,"and the finely wrought garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office,"
2,31,11,"and the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do."
2,31,12,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
2,31,13,"Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily ye shall keep my sabbaths: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am Jehovah who sanctifieth you."
2,31,14,"Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that profaneth it shall surely be put to death; for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people."
2,31,15,"Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to Jehovah: whosoever doeth any work on the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death."
2,31,16,"Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant."
2,31,17,"It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed."
2,31,18,"And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, the two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God."
2,32,1,"And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him."
2,32,2,"And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me."
2,32,3,"And all the people brake off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron."
2,32,4,"And he received it at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, and made it a molten calf: and they said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt."
2,32,5,"And when Aaron saw `this', he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To-morrow shall be a feast to Jehovah."
2,32,6,"And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt-offerings, and brought peace-offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play."
2,32,7,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, that thou broughtest up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:"
2,32,8,"they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed unto it, and said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt."
2,32,9,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:"
2,32,10,"now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation."
2,32,11,"And Moses besought Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, that thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?"
2,32,12,"Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, saying, For evil did he bring them forth, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people."
2,32,13,"Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever."
2,32,14,"And Jehovah repented of the evil which he said he would do unto his people."
2,32,15,"And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, with the two tables of the testimony in his hand; tables that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written."
2,32,16,"And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables."
2,32,17,"And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp."
2,32,18,"And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome; but the noise of them that sing do I hear."
2,32,19,"And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount."
2,32,20,"And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it."
2,32,21,"And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought a great sin upon them?"
2,32,22,"And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are `set' on evil."
2,32,23,"For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him."
2,32,24,"And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off: so they gave it me; and I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf."
2,32,25,"And when Moses saw that the people were broken loose, (for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies,)"
2,32,26,"then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Whoso is on Jehovah's side, `let him come' unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him."
2,32,27,"And he said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor."
2,32,28,"And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men."
2,32,29,"And Moses said, Consecrate yourselves to-day to Jehovah, yea, every man against his son, and against his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day."
2,32,30,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto Jehovah; peradventure I shall make atonement for your sin."
2,32,31,"And Moses returned unto Jehovah, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold."
2,32,32,"Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin-; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written."
2,32,33,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book."
2,32,34,"And now go, lead the people unto `the place' of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine angel shall go before thee; nevertheless in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them."
2,32,35,"And Jehovah smote the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made."
2,33,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, Depart, go up hence, thou and the people that thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land of which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:"
2,33,2,"and I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:"
2,33,3,"unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee, for thou art a stiffnecked people, lest I consume thee in the way."
2,33,4,"And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments."
2,33,5,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people; if I go up into the midst of thee for one moment, I shall consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee."
2,33,6,"And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from mount Horeb onward."
2,33,7,"Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it without the camp, afar off from the camp; and he called it, The tent of meeting. And it came to pass, that every one that sought Jehovah went out unto the tent of meeting, which was without the camp."
2,33,8,"And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the Tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the Tent."
2,33,9,"And it came to pass, when Moses entered into the Tent, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the Tent: and `Jehovah' spake with Moses."
2,33,10,"And all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man at his tent door."
2,33,11,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the Tent."
2,33,12,"And Moses said unto Jehovah, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found favor in my sight."
2,33,13,"Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thy sight, show me now thy ways, that I may know thee, to the end that I may find favor in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people."
2,33,14,"And he said, My presence shall go `with thee', and I will give thee rest."
2,33,15,"And he said unto him, If thy presence go not `with me', carry us not up hence."
2,33,16,"For wherein now shall it be known that I have found favor in thy sight, I and thy people? is it not in that thou goest with us, so that we are separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth?"
2,33,17,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken; for thou hast found favor in my sight, and I know thee by name."
2,33,18,"And he said, Show me, I pray thee, thy glory."
2,33,19,"And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and will proclaim the name of Jehovah before thee; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy."
2,33,20,"And he said, Thou canst not see my face; for man shall not see me and live."
2,33,21,"and Jehovah said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon the rock:"
2,33,22,"and it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand until I have passed by:"
2,33,23,"and I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my back; but my face shall not be seen."
2,34,1,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon the tables the words that were on the first tables, which thou brakest."
2,34,2,"And be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount."
2,34,3,"And no man shall come up with thee; neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount."
2,34,4,"And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as Jehovah had commanded him, and took in his hand two tables of stone."
2,34,5,"And Jehovah descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah."
2,34,6,"And Jehovah passed by before him, and proclaimed, Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness and truth,"
2,34,7,"keeping lovingkindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin; and that will by no means clear `the guilty', visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation."
2,34,8,"And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped."
2,34,9,"And he said, If now I have found favor in thy sight, O Lord, let the Lord, I pray thee, go in the midst of us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance."
2,34,10,"And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been wrought in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of Jehovah; for it is a terrible thing that I do with thee."
2,34,11,"Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite."
2,34,12,"Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:"
2,34,13,"but ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and ye shall cut down their Asherim;"
2,34,14,"for thou shalt worship no other god: for Jehovah, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:"
2,34,15,"lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they play the harlot after their gods, and sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee and thou eat of his sacrifice;"
2,34,16,"and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters play the harlot after their gods, and make thy sons play the harlot after their gods."
2,34,17,"Thou shalt make thee no molten gods."
2,34,18,"The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib; for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt."
2,34,19,"All that openeth the womb is mine; and all thy cattle that is male, the firstlings of cow and sheep."
2,34,20,"And the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck. All the first-born of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty."
2,34,21,"Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in plowing time and in harvest thou shalt rest."
2,34,22,"And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, `even' of the first-fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end."
2,34,23,"Three times in the year shall all thy males appear before the Lord Jehovah, the God of Israel."
2,34,24,"For I will cast out nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou goest up to appear before Jehovah thy God three times in the year."
2,34,25,"Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning."
2,34,26,"The first of the first-fruits of thy ground thou shalt bring unto the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother's milk."
2,34,27,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel."
2,34,28,"And he was there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments."
2,34,29,"And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of the testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him."
2,34,30,"And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him."
2,34,31,"And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses spake to them."
2,34,32,"And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that Jehovah had spoken with him in mount Sinai."
2,34,33,"And when Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face."
2,34,34,"But when Moses went in before Jehovah to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded."
2,34,35,"And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him."
2,35,1,"And Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of Israel, and said unto them, These are the words which Jehovah hath commanded, that ye should do them."
2,35,2,"Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day, a sabbath of solemn rest to Jehovah: whosoever doeth any work therein shall be put to death."
2,35,3,"Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day."
2,35,4,"And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which Jehovah commanded, saying,"
2,35,5,"Take ye from among you an offering unto Jehovah; whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, Jehovah's offering: gold, and silver, and brass,"
2,35,6,"and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' `hair',"
2,35,7,"and rams' skins dyed red, and sealskins, and acacia wood,"
2,35,8,"and oil for the light, and spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense,"
2,35,9,"and onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate."
2,35,10,"And let every wise-hearted man among you come, and make all that Jehovah hath commanded:"
2,35,11,"the tabernacle, its tent, and its covering, its clasps, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets;"
2,35,12,"the ark, and the staves thereof, the mercy-seat, and the veil of the screen;"
2,35,13,"the table, and its staves, and all its vessels, and the showbread;"
2,35,14,"the candlestick also for the light, and its vessels, and its lamps, and the oil for the light;"
2,35,15,"and the altar of incense, and its staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the screen for the door, at the door of the tabernacle;"
2,35,16,"the altar of burnt-offering, with its grating of brass, it staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base;"
2,35,17,"the hangings of the court, the pillars thereof, and their sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court;"
2,35,18,"the pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords;"
2,35,19,"the finely wrought garments, for ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office."
2,35,20,"And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses."
2,35,21,"And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, `and' brought Jehovah's offering, for the work of the tent of meeting, and for all the service thereof, and for the holy garments."
2,35,22,"And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing-hearted, `and' brought brooches, and ear-rings, and signet-rings, and armlets, all jewels of gold; even every man that offered an offering of gold unto Jehovah."
2,35,23,"And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' `hair', and rams' skins dyed red, and sealskins, brought them."
2,35,24,"Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought Jehovah's offering; and every man, with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service, brought it."
2,35,25,"And all the women that were wise-hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, the blue, and the purple, the scarlet, and the fine linen."
2,35,26,"And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats' `hair'."
2,35,27,"And the rulers brought the onyx stones, and the stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate;"
2,35,28,"and the spice, and the oil; for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense."
2,35,29,"The children of Israel brought a freewill-offering unto Jehovah; every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all the work, which Jehovah had commanded to be made by Moses."
2,35,30,"And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, Jehovah hath called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah."
2,35,31,"And he hath filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;"
2,35,32,"and to devise skilful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,"
2,35,33,"and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of skilful workmanship."
2,35,34,"And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan."
2,35,35,"Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of workmanship, of the engraver, and of the skilful workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any workmanship, and of those that devise skilful works."
2,36,1,"And Bezalel and Oholiab shall work, and every wise-hearted man, in whom Jehovah hath put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all the work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that Jehovah hath commanded."
2,36,2,"And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whose heart Jehovah had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:"
2,36,3,"and they received of Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, wherewith to make it. And they brought yet unto him freewill-offerings every morning."
2,36,4,"And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they wrought."
2,36,5,"And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which Jehovah commanded to make."
2,36,6,"And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing."
2,36,7,"For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much."
2,36,8,"And all the wise-hearted men among them that wrought the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains; of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, with cherubim, the work of the skilful workman, `Bezalel' made them."
2,36,9,"The length of each curtain was eight and twenty cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits: all the curtains had one measure."
2,36,10,"And he coupled five curtains one to another: and `the other' five curtains he coupled one to another."
2,36,11,"And he made loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the second coupling."
2,36,12,"Fifty loops made he in the one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain that was in the second coupling: the loops were opposite one to another."
2,36,13,"And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to another with the clasps: so the tabernacle was one."
2,36,14,"And he made curtains of goats' `hair' for a tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them."
2,36,15,"The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits the breadth of each curtain: the eleven curtains had one measure."
2,36,16,"And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves."
2,36,17,"And he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which was `outmost in' the second coupling."
2,36,18,"And he made fifty clasps of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one."
2,36,19,"And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of sealskins above."
2,36,20,"And he made the boards for the tabernacle, of acacia wood, standing up."
2,36,21,"Ten cubits was the length of a board, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each board."
2,36,22,"Each board had two tenons, joined one to another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle."
2,36,23,"And he made the boards for the tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side southward."
2,36,24,"And he made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons."
2,36,25,"And for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty boards,"
2,36,26,"and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board."
2,36,27,"And for the hinder part of the tabernacle westward he made six boards."
2,36,28,"And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the hinder part."
2,36,29,"And they were double beneath; and in like manner they were entire unto the top thereof unto one ring: thus he did to both of them in the two corners."
2,36,30,"And there were eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets; under every board two sockets."
2,36,31,"And he made bars of acacia wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,"
2,36,32,"and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the hinder part westward."
2,36,33,"And he made the middle bar to pass through in the midst of the boards from the one end to the other."
2,36,34,"And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold for places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold."
2,36,35,"And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubim, the work of the skilful workman, made he it."
2,36,36,"And he made thereunto four pillars of acacia, and overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; And he cast for them four sockets of silver."
2,36,37,"And he made a screen for the door of the Tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the embroiderer;"
2,36,38,"and the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their capitals and their fillets with gold; and their five sockets were of brass."
2,37,1,"And Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it:"
2,37,2,"and he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about."
2,37,3,"And he cast for it four rings of gold, in the four feet thereof; even two rings on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it."
2,37,4,"And he made staves of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold."
2,37,5,"And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark, to bear the ark."
2,37,6,"And he made a mercy-seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half `was' the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof."
2,37,7,"And he made two cherubim of gold; of beaten work made he them, at the two ends of the mercy-seat;"
2,37,8,"one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end: of one piece with the mercy-seat made he the cherubim at the two ends thereof."
2,37,9,"And the cherubim spread out their wings on high, covering the mercy-seat with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the mercy-seat were the faces of the cherubim."
2,37,10,"And he made the table of acacia wood: two cubits `was' the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof:"
2,37,11,"and he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereto a crown of gold round about."
2,37,12,"And he made unto it a border of a handbreadth round about, and made a golden crown to the border thereof round about."
2,37,13,"And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that were on the four feet thereof."
2,37,14,"Close by the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table."
2,37,15,"And he made the staves of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table."
2,37,16,"And he made the vessels which were upon the table, the dishes thereof, and the spoons thereof, and the bowls thereof, and the flagons thereof, wherewith to pour out, of pure gold."
2,37,17,"And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the candlestick, even its base, and its shaft; its cups, it knops, and its flowers, were of one piece with it:"
2,37,18,"and there were six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof:"
2,37,19,"three cups made like almond-blossoms in one branch, a knop and a flower, and three cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, a knop and a flower: so for the six branches going out of the candlestick."
2,37,20,"And in the candlestick were four cups made like almond-blossoms, the knops thereof, and the flowers thereof;"
2,37,21,"and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of it."
2,37,22,"Their knops and their branches were of one piece with it: the whole of it was one beaten work of pure gold."
2,37,23,"And he made the lamps thereof, seven, and the snuffers thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, of pure gold."
2,37,24,"Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof."
2,37,25,"And he made the altar of incense of acacia wood: a cubit was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, foursquare; and two cubits was the height thereof; the horns thereof were of one piece with it."
2,37,26,"And he overlaid it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: and he made unto it a crown of gold round about."
2,37,27,"And he made for it two golden rings under the crown thereof, upon the two ribs thereof, upon the two sides of it, for places for staves wherewith to bear it."
2,37,28,"And he made the staves of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold."
2,37,29,"And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices, after the art of the perfumer."
2,38,1,"And he made the altar of burnt-offering of acacia wood: five cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof, foursquare; and three cubits the height thereof."
2,38,2,"And he made the horns thereof upon the four corners of it; the horns thereof were of one piece with it: and he overlaid it with brass."
2,38,3,"And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basins, the flesh-hooks, and the firepans: all the vessels thereof made he of brass."
2,38,4,"And he made for the altar a grating of network of brass, under the ledge round it beneath, reaching halfway up."
2,38,5,"And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grating of brass, to be places for the staves."
2,38,6,"And he made the staves of acacia wood, and overlaid them with brass."
2,38,7,"And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, wherewith to bear it; he made it hollow with planks."
2,38,8,"And he made the laver of brass, and the base thereof of brass, of the mirrors of the ministering women that ministered at the door of the tent of meeting."
2,38,9,"And he made the court: for the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, a hundred cubits;"
2,38,10,"their pillars were twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver."
2,38,11,"And for the north side a hundred cubits, their pillars twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, of silver."
2,38,12,"And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, of silver."
2,38,13,"And for the east side eastward fifty cubits."
2,38,14,"The hangings for the one side `of the gate' were fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three;"
2,38,15,"and so for the other side: on this hand and that hand by the gate of the court were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three."
2,38,16,"All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen."
2,38,17,"And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, of silver; and the overlaying of their capitals, of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver."
2,38,18,"And the screen for the gate of the court was the work of the embroiderer, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court."
2,38,19,"And their pillars were four, and their sockets four, of brass; their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their capitals, and their fillets, of silver."
2,38,20,"And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, were of brass."
2,38,21,"This is the sum of `the things for' the tabernacle, even the tabernacle of the testimony, as they were counted, according to the commandment of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest."
2,38,22,"And Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that Jehovah commanded Moses."
2,38,23,"And with him was Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a skilful workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and in fine linen."
2,38,24,"All the gold that was used for the work in all the work of the sanctuary, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary."
2,38,25,"And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was a hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:"
2,38,26,"a beka a head, `that is', half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that passed over to them that were numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men."
2,38,27,"And the hundred talents of silver were for casting the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the veil; a hundred sockets for the hundred talents, a talent for a socket."
2,38,28,"And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five `shekels' he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their capitals, and made fillets for them."
2,38,29,"And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels."
2,38,30,"And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tent of meeting, and the brazen altar, and the brazen grating for it, and all the vessels of the altar,"
2,38,31,"and the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the gate of the court, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about."
2,39,1,"And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made finely wrought garments, for ministering in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as Jehovah commanded Moses."
2,39,2,"And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen."
2,39,3,"And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, the work of the skilful workman."
2,39,4,"They made shoulder-pieces for it, joined together; at the two ends was it joined together."
2,39,5,"And the skilfully woven band, that was upon it, wherewith to gird it on, was of the same piece `and' like the work thereof; of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as Jehovah commanded Moses."
2,39,6,"And they wrought the onyx stones, inclosed in settings of gold, graven with the engravings of a signet, according to the names of the children of Israel."
2,39,7,"And he put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, to be stones of memorial for the children of Israel; as Jehovah commanded Moses."
2,39,8,"And he made the breastplate, the work of the skilful workman, like the work of the ephod; of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen."
2,39,9,"It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being double."
2,39,10,"And they set in it four rows of stones. A row of sardius, topaz, and carbuncle was the first row;"
2,39,11,"and the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond;"
2,39,12,"and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;"
2,39,13,"and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jaspar: they were inclosed in inclosings of gold in their settings."
2,39,14,"And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names; like the engravings of a signet, every one according to his name, for the twelve tribes."
2,39,15,"And they made upon the breastplate chains like cords, of wreathen work of pure gold."
2,39,16,"And they made two settings of gold, and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate."
2,39,17,"And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings at the ends of the breastplate."
2,39,18,"And the `other' two ends of the two wreathen chains they put on the two settings, and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, in the forepart thereof."
2,39,19,"And they made two rings of gold, and put them upon the two ends of the breastplate, upon the edge thereof, which was toward the side of the ephod inward."
2,39,20,"And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod underneath, in the forepart thereof, close by the coupling thereof, above the skilfully woven band of the ephod."
2,39,21,"And they did bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be upon the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as Jehovah commanded Moses."
2,39,22,"And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue."
2,39,23,"And the hole of the robe in the midst thereof, as the hole of a coat of mail, with a binding round about the hole of it, that it should not be rent."
2,39,24,"And they made upon the skirts of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, `and' twined `linen'."
2,39,25,"And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the skirts of the robe round about, between the pomegranates;"
2,39,26,"a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe round about, to minister in; as Jehovah commanded Moses."
2,39,27,"And they made the coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,"
2,39,28,"and the mitre of fine linen, and the goodly head-tires of fine linen, and the linen breeches of fine twined linen,"
2,39,29,"and the girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, the work of the embroiderer; as Jehovah commanded Moses."
2,39,30,"And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like the engravings of a signet, HOLY TO JEHOVAH."
2,39,31,"And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it upon the mitre above; as Jehovah commanded Moses."
2,39,32,"Thus was finished all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting: and the children of Israel did according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses; so did they."
2,39,33,"And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the Tent, and all its furniture, its clasps, its boards, it bars, and its pillars, and it sockets;"
2,39,34,"and the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of sealskins, and the veil of the screen;"
2,39,35,"the ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy-seat;"
2,39,36,"the table, all the vessels thereof, and the showbread;"
2,39,37,"the pure candlestick, the lamps thereof, even the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for the light;"
2,39,38,"and the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the screen for the door of the Tent;"
2,39,39,"the brazen altar, and its grating of brass, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base;"
2,39,40,"the hangings of the court, its pillars, and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court, the cords thereof, and the pins thereof, and all the instruments of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting;"
2,39,41,"the finely wrought garments for ministering in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office."
2,39,42,"According to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did all the work."
2,39,43,"And Moses saw all the work, and, behold, they had done it; as Jehovah had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them."
2,40,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
2,40,2,"On the first day of the first month shalt thou rear up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting."
2,40,3,"And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and thou shalt screen the ark with the veil."
2,40,4,"And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof."
2,40,5,"And thou shalt set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the screen of the door to the tabernacle."
2,40,6,"And thou shalt set the altar of burnt-offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting."
2,40,7,"And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and shalt put water therein."
2,40,8,"And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the screen of the gate of the court."
2,40,9,"And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the furniture thereof: and it shall be holy."
2,40,10,"And thou shalt anoint the altar of burnt-offering, and all its vessels, and sanctify the altar: and the altar shall be most holy."
2,40,11,"And thou shalt anoint the laver and its base, and sanctify it."
2,40,12,"And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tent of meeting, and shalt wash them with water."
2,40,13,"And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments; and thou shalt anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office."
2,40,14,"And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them;"
2,40,15,"and thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: and their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations."
2,40,16,"Thus did Moses: according to all that Jehovah commanded him, so did he."
2,40,17,"And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up."
2,40,18,"And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and laid its sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up its pillars."
2,40,19,"And he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as Jehovah commanded Moses."
2,40,20,"And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy-seat above upon the ark:"
2,40,21,"and he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony; as Jehovah commanded Moses."
2,40,22,"And he put the table in the tent of meeting, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the veil."
2,40,23,"And he set the bread in order upon it before Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses."
2,40,24,"And he put the candlestick in the tent of meeting, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward."
2,40,25,"And he lighted the lamps before Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses."
2,40,26,"And he put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil:"
2,40,27,"and he burnt thereon incense of sweet spices; as Jehovah commanded Moses."
2,40,28,"And he put the screen of the door to the tabernacle."
2,40,29,"And he set the altar of burnt-offering at the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered upon it the burnt-offering and the meal-offering; as Jehovah commanded Moses."
2,40,30,"And he set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water therein, wherewith to wash."
2,40,31,"And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat;"
2,40,32,"when they went into the tent of meeting, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as Jehovah commanded Moses."
2,40,33,"And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work."
2,40,34,"Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle."
2,40,35,"And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of meeting, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle."
2,40,36,"And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys:"
2,40,37,"but if the cloud was not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up."
2,40,38,"For the cloud of Jehovah was upon the tabernacle by day, and there was fire therein by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys."
3,1,1,"And Jehovah called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tent of meeting, saying,"
3,1,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man of you offereth an oblation unto Jehovah, ye shall offer your oblation of the cattle, `even' of the herd and of the flock."
3,1,3,"If his oblation be a burnt-offering of the herd, he shall offer it a male without blemish: he shall offer it at the door of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before Jehovah."
3,1,4,"And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him."
3,1,5,"And he shall kill the bullock before Jehovah: and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall present the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is at the door of the tent of meeting."
3,1,6,"And he shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces."
3,1,7,"And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay wood in order upon the fire;"
3,1,8,"and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:"
3,1,9,"but its inwards and its legs shall he wash with water: and the priest shall burn the whole on the altar, for a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah."
3,1,10,"And if his oblation be of the flock, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-offering; he shall offer it a male without blemish."
3,1,11,"And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before Jehovah: and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall sprinkle its blood upon the altar round about."
3,1,12,"And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat; and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:"
3,1,13,"but the inwards and the legs shall he wash with water; and the priest shall offer the whole, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah."
3,1,14,"And if his oblation to Jehovah be a burnt-offering of birds, then he shall offer his oblation of turtle-doves, or of young pigeons."
3,1,15,"And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off its head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be drained out on the side of the altar;"
3,1,16,"and he shall take away its crop with the filth thereof, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, in the place of the ashes:"
3,1,17,"and he shall rend it by the wings thereof, `but' shall not divide it asunder; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah."
3,2,1,"And when any one offereth an oblation of a meal-offering unto Jehovah, his oblation shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon:"
3,2,2,"and he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests; and he shall take thereout his handful of the fine flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn `it as' the memorial thereof upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah:"
3,2,3,"and that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire."
3,2,4,"And when thou offerest an oblation of a meal-offering baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil."
3,2,5,"And if thy oblation be a meal-offering of the baking-pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil."
3,2,6,"Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meal-offering."
3,2,7,"And if thy oblation be a meal-offering of the frying-pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil."
3,2,8,"And thou shalt bring the meal-offering that is made of these things unto Jehovah: and it shall be presented unto the priest, and he shall bring it unto the altar."
3,2,9,"And the priest shall take up from the meal-offering the memorial thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah."
3,2,10,"And that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire."
3,2,11,"No meal-offering, which ye shall offer unto Jehovah, shall be made with leaven; for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, as an offering made by fire unto Jehovah."
3,2,12,"As an oblation of first -`fruits' ye shall offer them unto Jehovah: but they shall not come up for a sweet savor on the altar."
3,2,13,"And every oblation of thy meal-offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meal-offering: with all thine oblations thou shalt offer salt."
3,2,14,"And if thou offer a meal-offering of first-fruits unto Jehovah, thou shalt offer for the meal-offering of thy first-fruits grain in the ear parched with fire, bruised grain of the fresh ear."
3,2,15,"And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a meal-offering."
3,2,16,"And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the bruised grain thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto Jehovah."
3,3,1,"And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace-offerings; if he offer of the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before Jehovah."
3,3,2,"And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his oblation, and kill it at the door of the tent of meeting: and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about."
3,3,3,"And he shall offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,"
3,3,4,"and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away."
3,3,5,"And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt-offering, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah."
3,3,6,"And if his oblation for a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish."
3,3,7,"If he offer a lamb for his oblation, then shall he offer it before Jehovah;"
3,3,8,"and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his oblation, and kill it before the tent of meeting: and Aaron's sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about."
3,3,9,"And he shall offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; the fat thereof, the fat tail entire, he shall take away hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,"
3,3,10,"and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away."
3,3,11,"And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire unto Jehovah."
3,3,12,"And if his oblation be a goat, then he shall offer it before Jehovah:"
3,3,13,"and he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the tent of meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about."
3,3,14,"And he shall offer thereof his oblation, `even' an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,"
3,3,15,"and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away."
3,3,16,"And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire, for a sweet savor; all the fat is Jehovah's."
3,3,17,"It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that ye shall eat neither fat nor blood."
3,4,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,4,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any one shall sin unwittingly, in any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done, and shall do any one of them:"
3,4,3,"if the anointed priest shall sin so as to bring guilt on the people, then let him offer for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto Jehovah for a sin-offering."
3,4,4,"And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tent of meeting before Jehovah; and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the bullock, and kill the bullock before Jehovah."
3,4,5,"And the anointed priest shall take of the blood of the bullock, and bring it to the tent of meeting:"
3,4,6,"and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before Jehovah, before the veil of the sanctuary."
3,4,7,"And the priest shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before Jehovah, which is in the tent of meeting; and all the blood of the bullock shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting."
3,4,8,"And all the fat of the bullock of the sin-offering he shall take off from it; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,"
3,4,9,"and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away,"
3,4,10,"as it is taken off from the ox of the sacrifice of peace-offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of burnt-offering."
3,4,11,"And the skin of the bullock, and all its flesh, with its head, and with its legs, and its inwards, and its dung,"
3,4,12,"even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall it be burnt."
3,4,13,"And if the whole congregation of Israel err, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done, and are guilty;"
3,4,14,"when the sin wherein they have sinned is known, then the assembly shall offer a young bullock for a sin-offering, and bring it before the tent of meeting."
3,4,15,"And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before Jehovah; and the bullock shall be killed before Jehovah."
3,4,16,"And the anointed priest shall bring of the blood of the bullock to the tent of meeting:"
3,4,17,"and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before Jehovah, before the veil."
3,4,18,"And he shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before Jehovah, that is in the tent of meeting; and all the blood shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting."
3,4,19,"And all the fat thereof shall he take off from it, and burn it upon the altar."
3,4,20,"Thus shall he do with the bullock; as he did with the bullock of the sin-offering, so shall he do with this; and the priest shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven."
3,4,21,"And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bullock: it is the sin-offering for the assembly."
3,4,22,"When a ruler sinneth, and doeth unwittingly any one of all the things which Jehovah his God hath commanded not to be done, and is guilty;"
3,4,23,"if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, be made known to him, he shall bring for his oblation a goat, a male without blemish."
3,4,24,"And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt-offering before Jehovah: it is a sin-offering."
3,4,25,"And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering."
3,4,26,"And all the fat thereof shall he burn upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin, and he shall be forgiven."
3,4,27,"And if any one of the common people sin unwittingly, in doing any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done, and be guilty;"
3,4,28,"if his sin, which he hath sinned, be made known to him, then he shall bring for his oblation a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned."
3,4,29,"And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and kill the sin-offering in the place of burnt-offering."
3,4,30,"And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and all the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar."
3,4,31,"And all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savor unto Jehovah; and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven."
3,4,32,"And if he bring a lamb as his oblation for a sin-offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish."
3,4,33,"And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and kill it for a sin-offering in the place where they kill the burnt-offering."
3,4,34,"And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and all the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar:"
3,4,35,"and all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall burn them on the altar, upon the offerings of Jehovah made by fire; and the priest shall make atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned, and he shall be forgiven."
3,5,1,"And if any one sin, in that he heareth the voice of adjuration, he being a witness, whether he hath seen or known, if he do not utter `it', then he shall bear his iniquity."
3,5,2,"Or if any one touch any unclean thing, whether it be the carcass of an unclean beast, or the carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean creeping things, and it be hidden from him, and he be unclean, then he shall be guilty."
3,5,3,"Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever his uncleanness be wherewith he is unclean, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty."
3,5,4,"Or if any one swear rashly with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall utter rashly with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these `things'."
3,5,5,"And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these `things', that he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned:"
3,5,6,"and he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin."
3,5,7,"And if his means suffice not for a lamb, then he shall bring his trespass-offering for that wherein he hath sinned, two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, unto Jehovah; one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering."
3,5,8,"And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin-offering first, and wring off its head from its neck, but shall not divide it asunder:"
3,5,9,"and he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin-offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar: it is a sin-offering."
3,5,10,"And he shall offer the second for a burnt-offering, according to the ordinance; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin which he hath sinned, and he shall be forgiven."
3,5,11,"But if his means suffice not for two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, then he shall bring his oblation for that wherein he hath sinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering: he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon; for it is a sin-offering."
3,5,12,"And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as the memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, upon the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: it is a sin-offering."
3,5,13,"And the priest shall make atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in any of these things, and he shall be forgiven: and `the remnant' shall be the priest's, as the meal-offering."
3,5,14,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,5,15,"If any one commit a trespass, and sin unwittingly, in the holy things of Jehovah; then he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy estimation in silver by shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass-offering:"
3,5,16,"and he shall make restitution for that which he hath done amiss in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering, and he shall be forgiven."
3,5,17,"And if any one sin, and do any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done; though he knew it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity."
3,5,18,"And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy estimation, for a trespass-offering, unto the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning the thing wherein he erred unwittingly and knew it not, and he shall be forgiven."
3,5,19,"It is a trespass-offering: he is certainly guilty before Jehovah."
3,6,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,6,2,"If any one sin, and commit a trespass against Jehovah, and deal falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit, or of bargain, or of robbery, or have oppressed his neighbor,"
3,6,3,"or have found that which was lost, and deal falsely therein, and swear to a lie; in any of all these things that a man doeth, sinning therein;"
3,6,4,"then it shall be, if he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took by robbery, or the thing which he hath gotten by oppression, or the deposit which was committed to him, or the lost thing which he found,"
3,6,5,"or any thing about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in full, and shall add the fifth part more thereto: unto him to whom it appertaineth shall he give it, in the day of his being found guilty."
3,6,6,"And he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy estimation, for a trespass-offering, unto the priest:"
3,6,7,"and the priest shall make atonement for him before Jehovah; and he shall be forgiven concerning whatsoever he doeth so as to be guilty thereby."
3,6,8,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,6,9,"Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt-offering: the burnt-offering shall be on the hearth upon the altar all night unto the morning; and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning thereon."
3,6,10,"And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes whereto the fire hath consumed the burnt-offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar."
3,6,11,"And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place."
3,6,12,"And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereon, it shall not go out; and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning: and he shall lay the burnt-offering in order upon it, and shall burn thereon the fat of the peace-offerings."
3,6,13,"Fire shall be kept burning upon the altar continually; it shall not go out."
3,6,14,"And this is the law of the meal-offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before Jehovah, before the altar."
3,6,15,"And he shall take up therefrom his handful, of the fine flour of the meal-offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meal-offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savor, as the memorial thereof, unto Jehovah."
3,6,16,"And that which is left thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: it shall be eaten without leaven in a holy place; in the court of the tent of meeting they shall eat it."
3,6,17,"It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it as their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as the sin-offering, and as the trespass-offering."
3,6,18,"Every male among the children of Aaron shall eat of it, as `his' portion for ever throughout your generations, from the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: whosoever toucheth them shall be holy."
3,6,19,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,6,20,"This is the oblation of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto Jehovah in the day when he is anointed: the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering perpetually, half of it in the morning, and half thereof in the evening."
3,6,21,"On a baking-pan it shall be made with oil; when it is soaked, thou shalt bring it in: in baken pieces shalt thou offer the meal-offering for a sweet savor unto Jehovah."
3,6,22,"And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons shall offer it: by a statute for ever it shall be wholly burnt unto Jehovah."
3,6,23,"And every meal-offering of the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten."
3,6,24,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,6,25,"Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin-offering: in the place where the burnt-offering is killed shall the sin-offering be killed before Jehovah: it is most holy."
3,6,26,"The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in a holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting."
3,6,27,"Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy; and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in a holy place."
3,6,28,"But the earthen vessel wherein it is boiled shall be broken; and if it be boiled in a brazen vessel, it shall be scoured, and rinsed in water."
3,6,29,"Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most holy."
3,6,30,"And no sin-offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt with fire."
3,7,1,"And this is the law of the trespass-offering: it is most holy."
3,7,2,"In the place where they kill the burnt-offering shall they kill the trespass-offering; and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle upon the altar round about."
3,7,3,"And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof: the fat tail, and the fat that covereth the inwards,"
3,7,4,"and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away;"
3,7,5,"and the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto Jehovah: it is a trespass-offering."
3,7,6,"Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in a holy place: it is most holy."
3,7,7,"As is the sin-offering, so is the trespass-offering; there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith, he shall have it."
3,7,8,"And the priest that offereth any man's burnt-offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt-offering which he hath offered."
3,7,9,"And every meal-offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the frying-pan, and on the baking-pan, shall be the priest's that offereth it."
3,7,10,"And every meal-offering, mingled with oil, or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as well as another."
3,7,11,"And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which one shall offer unto Jehovah."
3,7,12,"If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour soaked."
3,7,13,"With cakes of leavened bread he shall offer his oblation with the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving."
3,7,14,"And of it he shall offer one out of each oblation for a heave-offering unto Jehovah; it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace-offerings."
3,7,15,"And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his oblation; he shall not leave any of it until the morning."
3,7,16,"But if the sacrifice of his oblation be a vow, or a freewill-offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offereth his sacrifice; and on the morrow that which remaineth of it shall be eaten:"
3,7,17,"but that which remaineth of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire."
3,7,18,"And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings be eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity."
3,7,19,"And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire. And as for the flesh, every one that is clean shall eat thereof:"
3,7,20,"but the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, that pertain unto Jehovah, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from his people."
3,7,21,"And when any one shall touch any unclean thing, the uncleanness of man, or an unclean beast, or any unclean abomination, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which pertain unto Jehovah, that soul shall be cut off from his people."
3,7,22,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,7,23,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat."
3,7,24,"And the fat of that which dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of beasts, may be used for any other service; but ye shall in no wise eat of it."
3,7,25,"For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people."
3,7,26,"And ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of bird or of beast, in any of your dwellings."
3,7,27,"Whosoever it be that eateth any blood, that soul shall be cut off from his people."
3,7,28,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,7,29,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace-offerings unto Jehovah shall bring his oblation unto Jehovah out of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings:"
3,7,30,"his own hands shall bring the offerings of Jehovah made by fire; the fat with the breast shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave-offering before Jehovah."
3,7,31,"And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar; but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'."
3,7,32,"And the right thigh shall ye give unto the priest for a heave-offering out of the sacrifices of your peace-offerings."
3,7,33,"He among the sons of Aaron that offereth the blood of the peace-offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion."
3,7,34,"For the wave-breast and the heave-thigh have I taken of the children of Israel out of the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons as `their' portion for ever from the children of Israel."
3,7,35,"This is the anointing-portion of Aaron, and the anointing-portion of his sons, out of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto Jehovah in the priest's office;"
3,7,36,"which Jehovah commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them. It is `their' portion for ever throughout their generations."
3,7,37,"This is the law of the burnt-offering, of the meal-offering, and of the sin-offering, and of the trespass-offering, and of the consecration, and of the sacrifice of peace-offerings;"
3,7,38,"which Jehovah commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto Jehovah, in the wilderness of Sinai."
3,8,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,8,2,"Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bullock of the sin-offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread;"
3,8,3,"and assemble thou all the congregation at the door of the tent of meeting."
3,8,4,"And Moses did as Jehovah commanded him; and the congregation was assembled at the door of the tent of meeting."
3,8,5,"And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded to be done."
3,8,6,"And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water."
3,8,7,"And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith."
3,8,8,"And he placed the breastplate upon him: and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim."
3,8,9,"And he set the mitre upon his head; and upon the mitre, in front, did he set the golden plate, the holy crown; as Jehovah commanded Moses."
3,8,10,"And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them."
3,8,11,"And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the laver and its base, to sanctify them."
3,8,12,"And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him."
3,8,13,"And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and clothed them with coats, and girded them with girdles, and bound head-tires upon them; as Jehovah commanded Moses."
3,8,14,"And he brought the bullock of the sin-offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock of the sin-offering."
3,8,15,"And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar, and sanctified it, to make atonement for it."
3,8,16,"And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat; and Moses burned it upon the altar."
3,8,17,"But the bullock, and its skin, and its flesh, and its dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as Jehovah commanded Moses."
3,8,18,"And he presented the ram of the burnt-offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram."
3,8,19,"And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about."
3,8,20,"And he cut the ram into its pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat."
3,8,21,"And he washed the inwards and the legs with water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt-offering for a sweet savor: it was an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses."
3,8,22,"And he presented the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram."
3,8,23,"And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood thereof, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot."
3,8,24,"And he brought Aaron's sons; and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about."
3,8,25,"And he took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right thigh:"
3,8,26,"and out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before Jehovah, he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat, and upon the right thigh:"
3,8,27,"and he put the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and waved them for a wave-offering before Jehovah."
3,8,28,"And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt-offering: they were a consecration for a sweet savor: it was an offering made by fire unto Jehovah."
3,8,29,"And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave-offering before Jehovah: it was Moses' portion of the ram of consecration; as Jehovah commanded Moses."
3,8,30,"And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him, and sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him."
3,8,31,"And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting: and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it."
3,8,32,"And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire."
3,8,33,"And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting seven days, until the days of your consecration be fulfilled: for he shall consecrate you seven days."
3,8,34,"As hath been done this day, so Jehovah hath commanded to do, to make atonement for you."
3,8,35,"And at the door of the tent of meeting shall ye abide day and night seven days, and keep the charge of Jehovah, that ye die not: for so I am commanded."
3,8,36,"And Aaron and his sons did all the things which Jehovah commanded by Moses."
3,9,1,"And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;"
3,9,2,"and he said unto Aaron, Take thee a calf of the herd for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, without blemish, and offer them before Jehovah."
3,9,3,"And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a he-goat for a sin-offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without blemish, for a burnt-offering;"
3,9,4,"and an ox and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before Jehovah; and a meal-offering mingled with oil: for to-day Jehovah appeareth unto you."
3,9,5,"And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tent of meeting: and all the congregation drew near and stood before Jehovah."
3,9,6,"And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah commanded that ye should do: and the glory of Jehovah shall appear unto you."
3,9,7,"And Moses said unto Aaron, Draw near unto the altar, and offer thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for the people; and offer the oblation of the people, and make atonement for them; as Jehovah commanded."
3,9,8,"So Aaron drew near unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin-offering, which was for himself."
3,9,9,"And the sons of Aaron presented the blood unto him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar:"
3,9,10,"but the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul from the liver of the sin-offering, he burnt upon the altar; as Jehovah commanded Moses."
3,9,11,"And the flesh and the skin he burnt with fire without the camp."
3,9,12,"And he slew the burnt-offering; and Aaron's sons delivered unto him the blood, and he sprinkled it upon the altar round about."
3,9,13,"And they delivered the burnt-offering unto him, piece by piece, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar."
3,9,14,"And he washed the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt-offering on the altar."
3,9,15,"And he presented the people's oblation, and took the goat of the sin-offering which was for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first."
3,9,16,"And he presented the burnt-offering, and offered it according to the ordinance."
3,9,17,"And he presented the meal-offering, and filled his hand therefrom, and burnt it upon the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning."
3,9,18,"He slew also the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons delivered unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,"
3,9,19,"and the fat of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covereth `the inwards', and the kidneys, and the caul of the liver:"
3,9,20,"and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:"
3,9,21,"and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave-offering before Jehovah; as Moses commanded."
3,9,22,"And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings."
3,9,23,"And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of Jehovah appeared unto all the people."
3,9,24,"And there came forth fire from before Jehovah, and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fat: and when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces."
3,10,1,"And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took each of them his censer, and put fire therein, and laid incense thereon, and offered strange fire before Jehovah, which he had not commanded them."
3,10,2,"And there came forth fire from before Jehovah, and devoured them, and they died before Jehovah."
3,10,3,"Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that Jehovah spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace."
3,10,4,"And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Draw near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp."
3,10,5,"So they drew near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said."
3,10,6,"And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Let not the hair of your heads go loose, neither rend your clothes; that ye die not, and that he be not wroth with all the congregation: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which Jehovah hath kindled."
3,10,7,"And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting, lest ye die; for the anointing oil of Jehovah is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses."
3,10,8,"And Jehovah spake unto Aaron, saying,"
3,10,9,"Drink no wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tent of meeting, that ye die not: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:"
3,10,10,"and that ye may make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean;"
3,10,11,"and that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which Jehovah hath spoken unto them by Moses."
3,10,12,"And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meal-offering that remaineth of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar; for it is most holy;"
3,10,13,"and ye shall eat it in a holy place, because it is thy portion, and thy sons' portion, of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: for so I am commanded."
3,10,14,"And the wave-breast and the heave-thigh shall ye eat in a clean place, thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they are given as thy portion, and thy sons' portion, out of the sacrifices of the peace-offerings of the children of Israel."
3,10,15,"The heave-thigh and the wave-breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave-offering before Jehovah: and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, as a portion for ever; as Jehovah hath commanded."
3,10,16,"And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin-offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron that were left, saying,"
3,10,17,"Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin-offering in the place of the sanctuary, seeing it is most holy, and he hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before Jehovah?"
3,10,18,"Behold, the blood of it was not brought into the sanctuary within: ye should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded."
3,10,19,"And Aaron spake unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin-offering and their burnt-offering before Jehovah; and there have befallen me such things as these: and if I had eaten the sin-offering to-day, would it have been well-pleasing in the sight of Jehovah?"
3,10,20,"And when Moses heard `that', it was well-pleasing in his sight."
3,11,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,"
3,11,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the living things which ye may eat among all the beasts that are on the earth."
3,11,3,"Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, `and' cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that may ye eat."
3,11,4,"Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that part the hoof: the camel, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you."
3,11,5,"And the coney, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you."
3,11,6,"And the hare, because she cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, she is unclean unto you."
3,11,7,"And the swine, because he parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, but cheweth not the cud, he is unclean unto you."
3,11,8,"Of their flesh ye shall not eat, and their carcasses ye shall not touch; they are unclean unto you."
3,11,9,"These may ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, that may ye eat."
3,11,10,"And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are an abomination unto you,"
3,11,11,"and they shall be an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, and their carcasses ye shall have in abomination."
3,11,12,"Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that is an abomination unto you."
3,11,13,"And these ye shall have in abomination among the birds; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the gier-eagle, and the ospray,"
3,11,14,"and the kite, and the falcon after its kind,"
3,11,15,"every raven after its kind,"
3,11,16,"and the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the seamew, and the hawk after its kind,"
3,11,17,"and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,"
3,11,18,"and the horned owl, and the pelican, and the vulture,"
3,11,19,"and the stork, the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat."
3,11,20,"All winged creeping things that go upon all fours are an abomination unto you."
3,11,21,"Yet these may ye eat of all winged creeping things that go upon all fours, which have legs above their feet, wherewith to leap upon the earth."
3,11,22,"Even these of them ye may eat: the locust after its kind, and the bald locust after its kind, and the cricket after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind."
3,11,23,"But all winged creeping things, which have four feet, are an abomination unto you."
3,11,24,"And by these ye shall become unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcass of them shall be unclean until the even;"
3,11,25,"And whosoever beareth `aught' of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even."
3,11,26,"Every beast which parteth the hoof, and is not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, is unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean."
3,11,27,"And whatsoever goeth upon its paws, among all beasts that go on all fours, they are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcass shall be unclean until the even."
3,11,28,"And he that beareth the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you."
3,11,29,"And these are they which are unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth: the weasel, and the mouse, and the great lizard after its kind,"
3,11,30,"and the gecko, and the land-crocodile, and the lizard, and the sand-lizard, and the chameleon."
3,11,31,"These are they which are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they are dead, shall be unclean until the even."
3,11,32,"And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherewith any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; then shall it be clean."
3,11,33,"And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean, and it ye shall break."
3,11,34,"All food `therein' which may be eaten, that on which water cometh, shall be unclean; and all drink that may be drunk in every `such' vessel shall be unclean."
3,11,35,"And every thing whereupon `any part' of their carcass falleth shall be unclean; whether oven, or range for pots, it shall be broken in pieces: they are unclean, and shall be unclean unto you."
3,11,36,"Nevertheless a fountain or a pit wherein is a gathering of water shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcass shall be unclean."
3,11,37,"And if `aught' of their carcass fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it is clean."
3,11,38,"But if water be put upon the seed, and `aught' of their carcass fall thereon, it is unclean unto you."
3,11,39,"And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcass thereof shall be unclean until the even."
3,11,40,"And he that eateth of the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even."
3,11,41,"And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth is an abomination; it shall not be eaten."
3,11,42,"Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all fours, or whatsoever hath many feet, even all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination."
3,11,43,"Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby."
3,11,44,"For I am Jehovah your God: sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that moveth upon the earth."
3,11,45,"For I am Jehovah that brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy."
3,11,46,"This is the law of the beast, and of the bird, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth;"
3,11,47,"to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean, and between the living thing that may be eaten and the living thing that may not be eaten."
3,12,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,12,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman conceive seed, and bear a man-child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of the impurity of her sickness shall she be unclean."
3,12,3,"And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised."
3,12,4,"And she shall continue in the blood of `her' purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled."
3,12,5,"But if she bear a maid-child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her impurity; and she shall continue in the blood of `her' purifying threescore and six days."
3,12,6,"And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb a year old for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtle-dove, for a sin-offering, unto the door of the tent of meeting, unto the priest:"
3,12,7,"and he shall offer it before Jehovah, and make atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood. This is the law for her that beareth, whether a male or a female."
3,12,8,"And if her means suffice not for a lamb, then she shall take two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons; the one for a burnt-offering, and the other for a sin-offering: and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean."
3,13,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,"
3,13,2,"When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, or a scab, or a bright spot, and it become in the skin of his flesh the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:"
3,13,3,"and the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and if the hair in the plague be turned white, and the appearance of the plague be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is the plague of leprosy; and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean."
3,13,4,"And if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white, then the priest shall shut up `him that hath' the plague seven days:"
3,13,5,"and the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if in his eyes the plague be at a stay, and the plague be not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:"
3,13,6,"and the priest shall look on him again the seventh day; and, behold, if the plague be dim, and the plague be not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean."
3,13,7,"But if the scab spread abroad in the skin, after that he hath showed himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall show himself to the priest again:"
3,13,8,"and the priest shall look; and, behold, if the scab be spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is leprosy."
3,13,9,"When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;"
3,13,10,"and the priest shall look; and, behold, if there be a white rising in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the rising,"
3,13,11,"it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean: he shall not shut him up, for he is unclean."
3,13,12,"And if the leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of `him that hath' the plague from his head even to his feet, as far as appeareth to the priest;"
3,13,13,"then the priest shall look; and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce `him' clean `that hath' the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean."
3,13,14,"But whensoever raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean."
3,13,15,"And the priest shall look on the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean: the raw flesh is unclean: it is leprosy."
3,13,16,"Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, then he shall come unto the priest;"
3,13,17,"and the priest shall look on him; and, behold, if the plague be turned into white, then the priest shall pronounce `him' clean `that hath' the plague: he is clean."
3,13,18,"And when the flesh hath in the skin thereof a boil, and it is healed,"
3,13,19,"and in the place of the boil there is a white rising, or a bright spot, reddish-white, then is shall be showed to the priest;"
3,13,20,"and the priest shall look; and, behold, if the appearance thereof be lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy, it hath broken out in the boil."
3,13,21,"But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and it be not lower than the skin, but be dim; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:"
3,13,22,"And if it spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague."
3,13,23,"But if the bright spot stay in its place, and be not spread, it is the scar of the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean."
3,13,24,"Or when the flesh hath in the skin thereof a burning by fire, and the quick `flesh' of the burning become a bright spot, reddish-white, or white;"
3,13,25,"then the priest shall look upon it; and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin; it is leprosy, it hath broken out in the burning: and the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy."
3,13,26,"But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the skin, but be dim; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:"
3,13,27,"and the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: if it spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy."
3,13,28,"And if the bright spot stay in its place, and be not spread in the skin, but be dim; it is the rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is the scar of the burning."
3,13,29,"And when a man or woman hath a plague upon the head or upon the beard,"
3,13,30,"then the priest shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin, and there be in it yellow thin hair, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a scall, it is leprosy of the head or of the beard."
3,13,31,"And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and there be no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up `him that hath' the plague of the scall seven days:"
3,13,32,"And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the scall be not spread, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the appearance of the scall be not deeper than the skin,"
3,13,33,"then he shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up `him that hath' the scall seven days more:"
3,13,34,"and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall; and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean."
3,13,35,"But if the scall spread abroad in the skin after his cleansing,"
3,13,36,"then the priest shall look on him; and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for the yellow hair; he is unclean."
3,13,37,"But if in his eyes the scall be at a stay, and black hair be grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean."
3,13,38,"And when a man or a woman hath in the skin of the flesh bright spots, even white bright spots;"
3,13,39,"then the priest shall look; and, behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be of a dull white, it is a tetter, it hath broken out in the skin; he is clean."
3,13,40,"And if a man's hair be fallen off his head, he is bald; `yet' is he clean."
3,13,41,"And if his hair be fallen off from the front part of his head, he is forehead bald; `yet' is he clean."
3,13,42,"But if there be in the bald head, or the bald forehead, a reddish-white plague; it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head, or his bald forehead."
3,13,43,"Then the priest shall look upon him; and, behold, if the rising of the plague be reddish-white in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh;"
3,13,44,"he is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall surely pronounce him unclean; his plague is in his head."
3,13,45,"And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go loose, and he shall cover his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean."
3,13,46,"All the days wherein the plague is in him he shall be unclean; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his dwelling be."
3,13,47,"The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a woollen garment, or a linen garment;"
3,13,48,"whether it be in warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in anything made of skin;"
3,13,49,"if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin; it is the plague of leprosy, and shall be showed unto the priest."
3,13,50,"And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up `that which hath' the plague seven days:"
3,13,51,"and he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, whatever service skin is used for; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean."
3,13,52,"And he shall burn the garment, whether the warp or the woof, in woollen or in linen, or anything of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire."
3,13,53,"And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin;"
3,13,54,"then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:"
3,13,55,"and the priest shall look, after that the plague is washed; and, behold, if the plague have not changed its color, and the plague be not spread, it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire: it is a fret, whether the bareness be within or without."
3,13,56,"And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be dim after the washing thereof, then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:"
3,13,57,"and if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it is breaking out: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire."
3,13,58,"And the garment, either the warp, or the woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean."
3,13,59,"This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or the woof, or anything of skin, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean."
3,14,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,14,2,"This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: he shall be brought unto the priest:"
3,14,3,"and the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look; and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper,"
3,14,4,"then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two living clean birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:"
3,14,5,"And the priest shall command to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water."
3,14,6,"As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water:"
3,14,7,"And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let go the living bird into the open field."
3,14,8,"And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and bathe himself in water; and he shall be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, but shall dwell outside his tent seven days."
3,14,9,"And it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and he shall be clean."
3,14,10,"And on the eighth day he shall take two he-lambs without blemish, and one ewe-lamb a year old without blemish, and three tenth parts `of an ephah' of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil."
3,14,11,"And the priest that cleanseth him shall set the man that is to be cleansed, and those things, before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of meeting."
3,14,12,"And the priest shall take one of the he-lambs, and offer him for a trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave-offering before Jehovah:"
3,14,13,"and he shall kill the he-lamb in the place where they kill the sin-offering and the burnt-offering, in the place of the sanctuary: for as the sin-offering is the priest's, so is the trespass-offering: it is most holy:"
3,14,14,"and the priest shall take of the blood of the trespass-offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot."
3,14,15,"And the priest shall take of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand;"
3,14,16,"and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before Jehovah:"
3,14,17,"and of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass-offering:"
3,14,18,"and the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make atonement for him before Jehovah."
3,14,19,"And the priest shall offer the sin-offering, and make atonement for him that is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness: and afterward he shall kill the burnt-offering;"
3,14,20,"and the priest shall offer the burnt-offering and the meal-offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean."
3,14,21,"And if he be poor, and cannot get so much, then he shall take one he-lamb for a trespass-offering to be waved, to make atonement for him, and one tenth part `of an ephah' of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering, and a log of oil;"
3,14,22,"and two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin-offering, and the other a burnt-offering."
3,14,23,"And on the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the door of the tent of meeting, before Jehovah:"
3,14,24,"and the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before Jehovah."
3,14,25,"And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass-offering; and the priest shall take of the blood of the trespass-offering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot."
3,14,26,"And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand;"
3,14,27,"and the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before Jehovah:"
3,14,28,"and the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass-offering:"
3,14,29,"and the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before Jehovah."
3,14,30,"And he shall offer one of the turtle-doves, or of the young pigeons, such as he is able to get,"
3,14,31,"even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, with the meal-offering: and the priest shall make atonement for him that is to be cleansed before Jehovah."
3,14,32,"This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, who is not able to get `that which pertaineth' to his cleansing."
3,14,33,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,"
3,14,34,"When ye are come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;"
3,14,35,"then he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, There seemeth to me to be as it were a plague in the house."
3,14,36,"And the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest goeth in to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house:"
3,14,37,"and he shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and the appearance thereof be lower than the wall;"
3,14,38,"then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days."
3,14,39,"And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look; and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house;"
3,14,40,"then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which the plague is, and cast them into an unclean place without the city:"
3,14,41,"and he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the mortar, that they scrape off, without the city into an unclean place:"
3,14,42,"and they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house."
3,14,43,"And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken out the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plastered;"
3,14,44,"then the priest shall come in and look; and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean."
3,14,45,"And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the mortar of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place."
3,14,46,"Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even."
3,14,47,"And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes."
3,14,48,"And if the priest shall come in, and look, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plastered; then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed."
3,14,49,"And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:"
3,14,50,"and he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:"
3,14,51,"and he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:"
3,14,52,"and he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:"
3,14,53,"but he shall let got the living bird out of the city into the open field: so shall he make atonement for the house; and it shall be clean."
3,14,54,"This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and for a scall,"
3,14,55,"and for the leprosy of a garment, and for a house,"
3,14,56,"and for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot;"
3,14,57,"to teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy."
3,15,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying,"
3,15,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath an issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean."
3,15,3,"And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his uncleanness."
3,15,4,"Every bed whereon he that hath the issue lieth shall be unclean; and everything whereon he sitteth shall be unclean."
3,15,5,"And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even."
3,15,6,"And he that sitteth on anything whereon he that hath the issue sat shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even."
3,15,7,"And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even."
3,15,8,"And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean, then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even."
3,15,9,"And what saddle soever he that hath the issue rideth upon shall be unclean."
3,15,10,"And whosoever toucheth anything that was under him shall be unclean until the even: and he that beareth those things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even."
3,15,11,"And whomsoever he that hath the issue toucheth, without having rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even."
3,15,12,"And the earthen vessel, which he that hath the issue toucheth, shall be broken; and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water."
3,15,13,"And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue, then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes; and he shall bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean."
3,15,14,"And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and come before Jehovah unto the door of the tent of meeting, and give them unto the priest:"
3,15,15,"and the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him before Jehovah for his issue."
3,15,16,"And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall bathe all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even."
3,15,17,"And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even."
3,15,18,"The woman also with whom a man shall lie with seed of copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the even."
3,15,19,"And if a woman have an issue, `and' her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be in her impurity seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even."
3,15,20,"And everything that she lieth upon in her impurity shall be unclean: everything also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean."
3,15,21,"And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even."
3,15,22,"And whosoever toucheth anything that she sitteth upon shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even."
3,15,23,"And if it be on the bed, or on anything whereon she sitteth, when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even."
3,15,24,"And if any man lie with her, and her impurity be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and every bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean."
3,15,25,"And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days not in the time of her impurity, or if she have an issue beyond the time of her impurity; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness she shall be as in the days of her impurity: she is unclean."
3,15,26,"Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her impurity: and everything whereon she sitteth shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her impurity."
3,15,27,"And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even."
3,15,28,"But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean."
3,15,29,"And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting."
3,15,30,"And the priest shall offer the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her before Jehovah for the issue of her uncleanness."
3,15,31,"Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness, that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that is in the midst of them."
3,15,32,"This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed of copulation goeth from him, so that he is unclean thereby;"
3,15,33,"and of her that is sick with her impurity, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean."
3,16,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before Jehovah, and died;"
3,16,2,"and Jehovah said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil, before the mercy-seat which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy-seat."
3,16,3,"Herewith shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering."
3,16,4,"He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with the linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: they are the holy garments; and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and put them on."
3,16,5,"And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two he-goats for a sin-offering, and one ram for a burnt-offering."
3,16,6,"And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself, and for his house."
3,16,7,"And he shall take the two goats, and set them before Jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting."
3,16,8,"And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for Jehovah, and the other lot for Azazel."
3,16,9,"And Aaron shall present the goat upon which the lot fell for Jehovah, and offer him for a sin-offering."
3,16,10,"But the goat, on which the lot fell for Azazel, shall be set alive before Jehovah, to make atonement for him, to send him away for Azazel into the wilderness."
3,16,11,"And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and shall make atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin-offering which is for himself:"
3,16,12,"and he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar before Jehovah, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:"
3,16,13,"and he shall put the incense upon the fire before Jehovah, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy-seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not:"
3,16,14,"and he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy-seat on the east; and before the mercy-seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times."
3,16,15,"Then shall he kill the goat of the sin-offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with his blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy-seat, and before the mercy-seat:"
3,16,16,"and he shall make atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleannesses of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, even all their sins: and so shall he do for the tent of meeting, that dwelleth with them in the midst of their uncleannesses."
3,16,17,"And there shall be no man in the tent of meeting when he goeth in to make atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel."
3,16,18,"And he shall go out unto the altar that is before Jehovah, and make atonement for it, and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about."
3,16,19,"And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleannesses of the children of Israel."
3,16,20,"And when he hath made an end of atoning for the holy place, and the tent of meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat:"
3,16,21,"and Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, even all their sins; and he shall put them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a man that is in readiness into the wilderness:"
3,16,22,"and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a solitary land: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness."
3,16,23,"And Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:"
3,16,24,"and he shall bathe his flesh in water in a holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt-offering and the burnt-offering of the people, and make atonement for himself and for the people."
3,16,25,"And the fat of the sin-offering shall he burn upon the altar."
3,16,26,"And he that letteth go the goat for Azazel shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp."
3,16,27,"And the bullock of the sin-offering, and the goat of the sin-offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall be carried forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung."
3,16,28,"And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp."
3,16,29,"And it shall be a statute for ever unto you: in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and shall do no manner of work, the home-born, or the stranger that sojourneth among you:"
3,16,30,"for on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins shall ye be clean before Jehovah."
3,16,31,"It is a sabbath of solemn rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; it is a statute for ever."
3,16,32,"And the priest, who shall be anointed and who shall be consecrated to be priest in his father's stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen garments, even the holy garments:"
3,16,33,"and he shall make atonement for the holy sanctuary; and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar; and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly."
3,16,34,"And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make atonement for the children of Israel because of all their sins once in the year. And he did as Jehovah commanded Moses."
3,17,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,17,2,"Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them: This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, saying,"
3,17,3,"What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it without the camp,"
3,17,4,"and hath not brought it unto the door of the tent of meeting, to offer it as an oblation unto Jehovah before the tabernacle of Jehovah: blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:"
3,17,5,"To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open field, even that they may bring them unto Jehovah, unto the door of the tent of meeting, unto the priest, and sacrifice them for sacrifices of peace-offerings unto Jehovah."
3,17,6,"And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of Jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting, and burn the fat for a sweet savor unto Jehovah."
3,17,7,"And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the he-goats, after which they play the harlot. This shall be a statute forever unto them throughout their generations."
3,17,8,"And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that offereth a burnt-offering or sacrifice,"
3,17,9,"and bringeth it not unto the door of the tent of meeting, to sacrifice it unto Jehovah; that man shall be cut off from his people."
3,17,10,"And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that eateth any manner of blood, I will set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people."
3,17,11,"For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh atonement by reason of the life."
3,17,12,"Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood."
3,17,13,"And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, who taketh in hunting any beast or bird that may be eaten; he shall pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust."
3,17,14,"For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is `all one' with the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh; for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off."
3,17,15,"And every soul that eateth that which dieth of itself, or that which is torn of beasts, whether he be home-born or a sojourner, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean."
3,17,16,"But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity."
3,18,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,18,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am Jehovah your God."
3,18,3,"After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do; neither shall ye walk in their statutes."
3,18,4,"Mine ordinances shall ye do, and my statutes shall ye keep, to walk therein: I am Jehovah your God."
3,18,5,"Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and mine ordinances; which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am Jehovah."
3,18,6,"None of you shall approach to any that are near of kin to him, to uncover `their' nakedness: I am Jehovah."
3,18,7,"The nakedness of thy father, even the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness."
3,18,8,"The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy father's nakedness."
3,18,9,"The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover."
3,18,10,"The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is thine own nakedness."
3,18,11,"The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness."
3,18,12,"Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister: she is thy father's near kinswoman."
3,18,13,"Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister: for she is thy mother's near kinswoman."
3,18,14,"Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt."
3,18,15,"Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter-in-law: she is thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness."
3,18,16,"Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it is thy brother's nakedness."
3,18,17,"Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; thou shalt not take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; they are near kinswomen: it is wickedness."
3,18,18,"And thou shalt not take a wife to her sister, to be a rival `to her', to uncover her nakedness, besides the other in her life-time."
3,18,19,"And thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is impure by her uncleanness."
3,18,20,"And thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbor's wife, to defile thyself with her."
3,18,21,"And thou shalt not give any of thy seed to make them pass through `the fire' to Molech; neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am Jehovah."
3,18,22,"Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination."
3,18,23,"And thou shalt not lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith; neither shall any woman stand before a beast, to lie down thereto: it is confusion."
3,18,24,"Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out from before you;"
3,18,25,"And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land vomiteth out her inhabitants."
3,18,26,"Ye therefore shall keep my statutes and mine ordinances, and shall not do any of these abominations; neither the home-born, nor the stranger that sojourneth among you;"
3,18,27,"(for all these abominations have the men of the land done, that were before you, and the land is defiled);"
3,18,28,"that the land vomit not you out also, when ye defile it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you."
3,18,29,"For whosoever shall do any of these abominations, even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people."
3,18,30,"Therefore shall ye keep my charge, that ye practise not any of these abominable customs, which were practised before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am Jehovah your God."
3,19,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,19,2,"Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy; for I Jehovah your God am holy."
3,19,3,"Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father; and ye shall keep my sabbaths: I am Jehovah your God."
3,19,4,"Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am Jehovah your God."
3,19,5,"And when ye offer a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah, ye shall offer it that ye may be accepted."
3,19,6,"It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if aught remain until the third day, it shall be burnt with fire."
3,19,7,"And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is an abomination; it shall not be accepted:"
3,19,8,"but every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the holy thing of Jehovah: and that soul shall be cut off from his people."
3,19,9,"And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest."
3,19,10,"And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather the fallen fruit of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and for the sojourner: I am Jehovah your God."
3,19,11,"Ye shall not steal; neither shall ye deal falsely, nor lie one to another."
3,19,12,"And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, and profane the name of thy God: I am Jehovah."
3,19,13,"Thou shalt not oppress thy neighbor, nor rob him: the wages of a hired servant shall not abide with thee all night until the morning."
3,19,14,"Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind; but thou shalt fear thy God: I am Jehovah."
3,19,15,"Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty; but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor."
3,19,16,"Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbor: I am Jehovah."
3,19,17,"Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart: thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbor, and not bear sin because of him."
3,19,18,"Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people; but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself: I am Jehovah."
3,19,19,"Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed: neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together."
3,19,20,"And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to a husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; they shall be punished; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free."
3,19,21,"And he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah, unto the door of the tent of meeting, even a ram for a trespass-offering."
3,19,22,"And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering before Jehovah for his sin which he hath sinned: and the sin which he hath sinned shall be forgiven him."
3,19,23,"And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as their uncircumcision: three years shall they be as uncircumcised unto you; it shall not be eaten."
3,19,24,"But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy, for giving praise unto Jehovah."
3,19,25,"And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am Jehovah your God."
3,19,26,"Ye shall not eat anything with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantments, nor practise augury."
3,19,27,"Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard."
3,19,28,"Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am Jehovah."
3,19,29,"Profane not thy daughter, to make her a harlot; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness."
3,19,30,"Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary; I am Jehovah."
3,19,31,"Turn ye not unto them that have familiar spirits, nor unto the wizards; seek them not out, to be defiled by them: I am Jehovah your God."
3,19,32,"Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man, and thou shalt fear thy God: I am Jehovah."
3,19,33,"And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not do him wrong."
3,19,34,"The stranger that sojourneth with you shall be unto you as the home-born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God."
3,19,35,"Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measures of length, of weight, or of quantity."
3,19,36,"Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt."
3,19,37,"And ye shall observe all my statutes, and all mine ordinances, and do them: I am Jehovah."
3,20,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,20,2,"Moreover, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones."
3,20,3,"I also will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name."
3,20,4,"And if the people at the land do at all hide their eyes from that man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and put him not to death;"
3,20,5,"then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that play the harlot after him, to play the harlot with Molech, from among their people."
3,20,6,"And the soul that turneth unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto the wizards, to play the harlot after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people."
3,20,7,"Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy; for I am Jehovah your God."
3,20,8,"And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am Jehovah who sanctifieth you."
3,20,9,"For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him."
3,20,10,"And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbor's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death."
3,20,11,"And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them."
3,20,12,"And if a man lie with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them."
3,20,13,"And if a man lie with mankind, as with womankind, both of them have committed abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them."
3,20,14,"And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you."
3,20,15,"And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast."
3,20,16,"And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them."
3,20,17,"And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a shameful thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity."
3,20,18,"And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath made naked her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people."
3,20,19,"And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister; for he hath made naked his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity."
3,20,20,"And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless."
3,20,21,"And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is impurity: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless."
3,20,22,"Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all mine ordinances, and do them; that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, vomit you not out."
3,20,23,"And ye shall not walk in the customs of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they did all these things, and therefore I abhorred them."
3,20,24,"But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey: I am Jehovah your God, who hath separated you from the peoples."
3,20,25,"Ye shall therefore make a distinction between the clean beast and the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and the clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by bird, or by anything wherewith the ground teemeth, which I have separated from you as unclean."
3,20,26,"And ye shall be holy unto me: for I, Jehovah, am holy, and have set you apart from the peoples, that ye should be mine."
3,20,27,"A man also or a woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones; their blood shall be upon them."
3,21,1,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none defile himself for the dead among his people;"
3,21,2,"except for his kin, that is near unto him, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother,"
3,21,3,"and for his sister a virgin, that is near unto him, that hath had no husband; for her may he defile himself."
3,21,4,"He shall not defile himself, `being' a chief man among his people, to profane himself."
3,21,5,"They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh."
3,21,6,"They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God; for the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy."
3,21,7,"They shall not take a woman that is a harlot, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God."
3,21,8,"Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I Jehovah, who sanctify you, am holy."
3,21,9,"And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the harlot, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire."
3,21,10,"And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil is poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not let the hair of his head go loose, nor rend his clothes;"
3,21,11,"neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;"
3,21,12,"neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am Jehovah."
3,21,13,"And he shall take a wife in her virginity."
3,21,14,"A widow, or one divorced, or a profane woman, a harlot, these shall he not take: but a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife."
3,21,15,"And he shall not profane his seed among his people: for I am Jehovah who sanctifieth him."
3,21,16,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,21,17,"Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed throughout their generations that hath a blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God."
3,21,18,"For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or anything superfluous,"
3,21,19,"or a man that is broken-footed, or broken-handed,"
3,21,20,"or crook-backed, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or is scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;"
3,21,21,"no man of the seed of Aaron the priest, that hath a blemish, shall come nigh to offer the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God."
3,21,22,"He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy:"
3,21,23,"only he shall not go in unto the veil, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I am Jehovah who sanctifieth them."
3,21,24,"So Moses spake unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel."
3,22,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,22,2,"Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, which they hallow unto me, and that they profane not my holy name: I am Jehovah."
3,22,3,"Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed throughout your generations, that approacheth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto Jehovah, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from before me: I am Jehovah."
3,22,4,"What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath an issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth anything that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;"
3,22,5,"or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;"
3,22,6,"the soul that toucheth any such shall be unclean until the even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water."
3,22,7,"And when the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he shall eat of the holy things, because it is his bread."
3,22,8,"That which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts, he shall not eat, to defile himself therewith: I am Jehovah."
3,22,9,"They shall therefore keep my charge, lest they bear sin for it, and die therein, if they profane it: I am Jehovah who sanctifieth them."
3,22,10,"There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest's, or a hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing."
3,22,11,"But if a priest buy any soul, the purchase of his money, he shall eat of it; and such as are born in his house, they shall eat of his bread."
3,22,12,"And if a priest's daughter be married unto a stranger, she shall not eat of the heave-offering of the holy things."
3,22,13,"But if a priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and be returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's bread: but there shall no stranger eat thereof."
3,22,14,"And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give unto the priest the holy thing."
3,22,15,"And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto Jehovah,"
3,22,16,"and `so' cause them to bear the iniquity that bringeth guilt, when they eat their holy things: for I am Jehovah who sanctifieth them."
3,22,17,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,22,18,"Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whosoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners in Israel, that offereth his oblation, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their freewill-offerings, which they offer unto Jehovah for a burnt-offering;"
3,22,19,"that ye may be accepted, `ye shall offer' a male without blemish, of the bullocks, of the sheep, or of the goats."
3,22,20,"But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you."
3,22,21,"And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah to accomplish a vow, or for a freewill-offering, of the herd or of the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein."
3,22,22,"Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto Jehovah, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto Jehovah."
3,22,23,"Either a bullock or a lamb that hath anything superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill-offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted."
3,22,24,"That which hath its stones bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut, ye shall not offer unto Jehovah; neither shall ye do `thus' in your land."
3,22,25,"Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them: they shall not be accepted for you."
3,22,26,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,22,27,"When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for the oblation of an offering made by fire unto Jehovah."
3,22,28,"And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day."
3,22,29,"And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto Jehovah, ye shall sacrifice it that ye may be accepted."
3,22,30,"On the same day it shall be eaten; ye shall leave none of it until the morning: I am Jehovah."
3,22,31,"Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am Jehovah."
3,22,32,"And ye shall not profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am Jehovah who halloweth you,"
3,22,33,"who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Jehovah."
3,23,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,23,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, The set feasts of Jehovah, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my set feasts."
3,23,3,"Six days shall work be done: but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of work: it is a sabbath unto Jehovah in all your dwellings."
3,23,4,"These are the set feasts of Jehovah, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season."
3,23,5,"In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, is Jehovah's passover."
3,23,6,"And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto Jehovah: seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread."
3,23,7,"In the first day ye shall have a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work."
3,23,8,"But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah seven days: in the seventh day is a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work."
3,23,9,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,23,10,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring the sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest unto the priest:"
3,23,11,"and he shall wave the sheaf before Jehovah, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it."
3,23,12,"And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish a year old for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah."
3,23,13,"And the meal-offering thereof shall be two tenth parts `of an ephah' of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah for a sweet savor; and the drink-offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin."
3,23,14,"And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the oblation of your God: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings."
3,23,15,"And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave-offering; seven sabbaths shall there be complete:"
3,23,16,"even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meal-offering unto Jehovah."
3,23,17,"Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave-loaves of two tenth parts `of an ephah': they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baken with leaven, for first-fruits unto Jehovah."
3,23,18,"And ye shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish a year old, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be a burnt-offering unto Jehovah, with their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah."
3,23,19,"And ye shall offer one he-goat for a sin-offering, and two he-lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace-offerings."
3,23,20,"And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first-fruits for a wave-offering before Jehovah, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to Jehovah for the priest."
3,23,21,"And ye shall make proclamation on the selfsame day; there shall be a holy convocation unto you; ye shall do no servile work: it is a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations."
3,23,22,"And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them for the poor, and for the sojourner: I am Jehovah your God."
3,23,23,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,23,24,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest unto you, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation."
3,23,25,"Ye shall do no servile work; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah."
3,23,26,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,23,27,"Howbeit on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement: it shall be a holy convocation unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah."
3,23,28,"And ye shall do no manner of work in that same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before Jehovah your God."
3,23,29,"For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day; he shall be cut off from his people."
3,23,30,"And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any manner of work in that same day, that soul will I destroy from among his people."
3,23,31,"Ye shall do no manner of work: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings."
3,23,32,"It shall be unto you a sabbath of solemn rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye keep your sabbath."
3,23,33,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,23,34,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto Jehovah."
3,23,35,"On the first day shall be a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work."
3,23,36,"Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah: on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah: it is a solemn assembly; ye shall do no servile work."
3,23,37,"These are the set feasts of Jehovah, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, a burnt-offering, and a meal-offering, a sacrifice, and drink-offerings, each on its own day;"
3,23,38,"besides the sabbaths o Jehovah, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill-offerings, which ye give unto Jehovah."
3,23,39,"Howbeit on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruits of the land, ye shall keep the feast of Jehovah seven days: on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest."
3,23,40,"And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before Jehovah your God seven days."
3,23,41,"And ye shall keep it a feast unto Jehovah seven days in the year: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations; ye shall keep it in the seventh month."
3,23,42,"Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are home-born in Israel shall dwell in booths;"
3,23,43,"that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God."
3,23,44,"And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the set feasts of Jehovah."
3,24,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,24,2,"Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually."
3,24,3,"Without the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, shall Aaron keep it in order from evening to morning before Jehovah continually: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations."
3,24,4,"He shall keep in order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before Jehovah continually."
3,24,5,"And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth parts `of an ephah' shall be in one cake."
3,24,6,"And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before Jehovah."
3,24,7,"And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto Jehovah."
3,24,8,"Every sabbath day he shall set it in order before Jehovah continually; it is on the behalf of the children of Israel, an everlasting covenant."
3,24,9,"And it shall be for Aaron and his sons; and they shall eat it in a holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire by a perpetual statute."
3,24,10,"And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp:"
3,24,11,"and the son of the Israelitish woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him unto Moses. And his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan."
3,24,12,"And they put him in ward, that it might be declared unto them at the mouth of Jehovah."
3,24,13,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,24,14,"Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him."
3,24,15,"And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin."
3,24,16,"And he that blasphemeth the name of Jehovah, he shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the sojourner, as the home-born, when he blasphemeth the name `of Jehovah', shall be put to death."
3,24,17,"And he that smiteth any man mortally shall surely be put to death."
3,24,18,"And he that smiteth a beast mortally shall make it good, life for life."
3,24,19,"And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him:"
3,24,20,"breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be rendered unto him."
3,24,21,"And he that killeth a beast shall make it good: and he that killeth a man shall be put to death."
3,24,22,"Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the sojourner, as for the home-born: for I am Jehovah your God."
3,24,23,"And Moses spake to the children of Israel; and they brought forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. And the children of Israel did as Jehovah commanded Moses."
3,25,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,"
3,25,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto Jehovah."
3,25,3,"Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruits thereof;"
3,25,4,"but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a sabbath unto Jehovah: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard."
3,25,5,"That which groweth of itself of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, and the grapes of thy undressed vine thou shalt not gather: it shall be a year of solemn rest for the land."
3,25,6,"And the sabbath of the land shall be for food for you; for thee, and for thy servant and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger, who sojourn with thee."
3,25,7,"And for thy cattle, and for the beasts that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be for food."
3,25,8,"And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and there shall be unto thee the days of seven sabbaths of years, even forty and nine years."
3,25,9,"Then shalt thou send abroad the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month; in the day of atonement shall ye send abroad the trumpet throughout all your land."
3,25,10,"And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family."
3,25,11,"A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather `the grapes' in it of the undressed vines."
3,25,12,"For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field."
3,25,13,"In this year of jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession."
3,25,14,"And if thou sell aught unto thy neighbor, or buy of thy neighbor's hand, ye shall not wrong one another."
3,25,15,"According to the number of years after the jubilee thou shalt buy of thy neighbor, `and' according unto the number of years of the crops he shall sell unto thee."
3,25,16,"According to the multitude of the years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of the years thou shalt diminish the price of it; for the number of the crops doth he sell unto thee."
3,25,17,"And ye shall not wrong one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I am Jehovah your God."
3,25,18,"Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep mine ordinances and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety."
3,25,19,"And the land shall yield its fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety."
3,25,20,"And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? Behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase;"
3,25,21,"then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years."
3,25,22,"And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the fruits, the old store; until the ninth year, until its fruits come in, ye shall eat the old store."
3,25,23,"And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity; for the land is mine: for ye are strangers and sojourners with me."
3,25,24,"And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land."
3,25,25,"If thy brother be waxed poor, and sell some of his possession, then shall his kinsman that is next unto him come, and shall redeem that which his brother hath sold."
3,25,26,"And if a man have no one to redeem it, and he be waxed rich and find sufficient to redeem it;"
3,25,27,"then let him reckon the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; and he shall return unto his possession."
3,25,28,"But if he be not able to get it back for himself, then that which he hath sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubilee: and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession."
3,25,29,"And if a man sell a dwelling-house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; for a full year shall he have the right of redemption."
3,25,30,"And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him that bought it, throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubilee."
3,25,31,"But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee."
3,25,32,"Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time."
3,25,33,"And if one of the Levites redeem, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel."
3,25,34,"But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession."
3,25,35,"And if thy brother be waxed poor, and his hand fail with thee; then thou shalt uphold him: `as' a stranger and a sojourner shall he live with thee."
3,25,36,"Take thou no interest of him or increase, but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee."
3,25,37,"Thou shalt not give him thy money upon interest, nor give him thy victuals for increase."
3,25,38,"I am Jehovah your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, `and' to be your God."
3,25,39,"And if thy brother be waxed poor with thee, and sell himself unto thee; thou shalt not make him to serve as a bond-servant."
3,25,40,"As a hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee; he shall serve with thee unto the year of jubilee:"
3,25,41,"then shall he go out from thee, he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return."
3,25,42,"For they are my servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen."
3,25,43,"Thou shalt not rule over him with rigor, but shalt fear thy God."
3,25,44,"And as for thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, whom thou shalt have; of the nations that are round about you, of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids."
3,25,45,"Moreover of the children of the strangers that sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they have begotten in your land: and they shall be your possession."
3,25,46,"And ye shall make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession; of them shall ye take your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel ye shall not rule, one over another, with rigor."
3,25,47,"And if a stranger or sojourner with thee be waxed rich, and thy brother be waxed poor beside him, and sell himself unto the stranger `or' sojourner with thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family;"
3,25,48,"after that he is sold he may be redeemed: one of his brethren may redeem him;"
3,25,49,"or his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be waxed rich, he may redeem himself."
3,25,50,"And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he sold himself to him unto the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years; according to the time of a hired servant shall he be with him."
3,25,51,"If there be yet many years, according unto them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for."
3,25,52,"And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according unto his years shall he give back the price of his redemption."
3,25,53,"As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him: he shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight."
3,25,54,"And if he be not redeemed by these `means', then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, he, and his children with him."
3,25,55,"For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God."
3,26,1,"Ye shall make you no idols, neither shall ye rear you up a graven image, or a pillar, neither shall ye place any figured stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am Jehovah your God."
3,26,2,"Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am Jehovah."
3,26,3,"If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;"
3,26,4,"then I will give your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit."
3,26,5,"And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time; and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely."
3,26,6,"And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land."
3,26,7,"And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword."
3,26,8,"And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword."
3,26,9,"And I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and will establish my covenant with you."
3,26,10,"And ye shall eat old store long kept, and ye shall bring forth the old because of the new."
3,26,11,"And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you."
3,26,12,"And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people."
3,26,13,"I am Jehovah your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright."
3,26,14,"But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;"
3,26,15,"and if ye shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhor mine ordinances, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant;"
3,26,16,"I also will do this unto you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away; and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it."
3,26,17,"And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be smitten before your enemies: they that hate you shall rule over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you."
3,26,18,"And if ye will not yet for these things hearken unto me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins."
3,26,19,"And I will break the pride of your power: and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass;"
3,26,20,"and your strength shall be spent in vain; for your land shall not yield its increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit."
3,26,21,"And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins."
3,26,22,"And I will send the beast of the field among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your ways shall become desolate."
3,26,23,"And if by these things ye will not be reformed unto me, but will walk contrary unto me;"
3,26,24,"then will I also walk contrary unto you; and I will smite you, even I, seven times for your sins."
3,26,25,"And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and ye shall be gathered together within your cities: and I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy."
3,26,26,"When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied."
3,26,27,"And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;"
3,26,28,"then I will walk contrary unto you in wrath; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins."
3,26,29,"And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat."
3,26,30,"And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-images, and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols; and my soul shall abhor you."
3,26,31,"And I will make your cities a waste, and will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors."
3,26,32,"And I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies that dwell therein shall be astonished at it."
3,26,33,"And you will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you: and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste."
3,26,34,"Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye are in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy its sabbaths."
3,26,35,"As long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it."
3,26,36,"And as for them that are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one fleeth from the sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth."
3,26,37,"And they shall stumble one upon another, as it were before the sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies."
3,26,38,"And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up."
3,26,39,"And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them."
3,26,40,"And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that, because they walked contrary unto me,"
3,26,41,"I also walked contrary unto them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity;"
3,26,42,"then will I remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land."
3,26,43,"The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its sabbaths, while it lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected mine ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes."
3,26,44,"And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am Jehovah their God;"
3,26,45,"but I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am Jehovah."
3,26,46,"These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which Jehovah made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by Moses."
3,27,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
3,27,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall accomplish a vow, the persons shall be for Jehovah by thy estimation."
3,27,3,"And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary."
3,27,4,"And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels."
3,27,5,"And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels."
3,27,6,"And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver."
3,27,7,"And if it be from sixty years old and upward; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels."
3,27,8,"But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of him that vowed shall the priest value him."
3,27,9,"And if it be a beast, whereof men offer an oblation unto Jehovah, all that any man giveth of such unto Jehovah shall be holy."
3,27,10,"He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy."
3,27,11,"And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer an oblation unto Jehovah, then he shall set the beast before the priest;"
3,27,12,"and the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou the priest valuest it, so shall it be."
3,27,13,"But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part thereof unto thy estimation."
3,27,14,"And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto Jehovah, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand."
3,27,15,"And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his."
3,27,16,"And if a man shall sanctify unto Jehovah part of the field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the sowing thereof: the sowing of a homer of barley `shall be valued' at fifty shekels of silver."
3,27,17,"If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy estimation it shall stand."
3,27,18,"But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain unto the year of jubilee; and an abatement shall be made from thy estimation."
3,27,19,"And if he that sanctified the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him."
3,27,20,"And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more:"
3,27,21,"but the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be holy unto Jehovah, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's."
3,27,22,"And if he sanctify unto Jehovah a field which he hath bought, which is not of the field of his possession;"
3,27,23,"then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation unto the year of jubilee: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto Jehovah."
3,27,24,"In the year of jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongeth."
3,27,25,"And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel."
3,27,26,"Only the firstling among beasts, which is made a firstling to Jehovah, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox or sheep, it is Jehovah's."
3,27,27,"And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall ransom it according to thine estimation, and shall add unto it the fifth part thereof: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation."
3,27,28,"Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto Jehovah of all that he hath, whether of man or beast, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto Jehovah."
3,27,29,"No one devoted, that shall be devoted from among men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death."
3,27,30,"And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is Jehovah's: it is holy unto Jehovah."
3,27,31,"And if a man will redeem aught of his tithe, he shall add unto it the fifth part thereof."
3,27,32,"And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto Jehovah."
3,27,33,"He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed."
3,27,34,"These are the commandments, which Jehovah commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai."

These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting."
4,4,16,"And the charge of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the continual meal-offering, and the anointing oil, the charge of all the tabernacle, and of all that therein is, the sanctuary, and the furniture thereof."
4,4,17,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,"
4,4,18,"Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites;"
4,4,19,"but thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden;"
4,4,20,"but they shall not go in to see the sanctuary even for a moment, lest they die."
4,4,21,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,4,22,"Take the sum of the sons of Gershon also, by their fathers' houses, by their families;"

4,4,34,"And Moses and Aaron and the princes of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kohathites by their families, and by their fathers' houses,"
4,4,35,"from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entered upon the service, for work in the tent of meeting:"
4,4,36,"and those that were numbered of them by their families were two thousand seven hundred and fifty."

4,4,49,"According to the commandment of Jehovah they were numbered by Moses, every one according to his service, and according to his burden: thus were they numbered of him, as Jehovah commanded Moses."
4,5,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,5,2,"Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is unclean by the dead:"
4,5,3,"both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their camp, in the midst whereof I dwell."
4,5,4,"And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp; as Jehovah spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel."
4,5,5,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,5,6,"Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, so as to trespass against Jehovah, and that soul shall be guilty;"
4,5,7,"then he shall confess his sin which he hath done: and he shall make restitution for his guilt in full, and add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him in respect of whom he hath been guilty."
4,5,8,"But if the man have no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for guilt which is made unto Jehovah shall be the priest's; besides the ram of the atonement, whereby atonement shall be made for him."
4,5,9,"And every heave-offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they present unto the priest, shall be his."
4,5,10,"And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man giveth the priest, it shall be his."
4,5,11,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,5,12,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,"
4,5,13,"and a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, and she be not taken in the act;"
4,5,14,"and the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled:"
4,5,15,"then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and shall bring her oblation for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is a meal-offering of jealousy, a meal-offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance."
4,5,16,"And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before Jehovah:"
4,5,17,"and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water."
4,5,18,"And the priest shall set the woman before Jehovah, and let the hair of the woman's head go loose, and put the meal-offering of memorial in her hands, which is the meal-offering of jealousy: and the priest shall have in his hand the water of bitterness that causeth the curse."
4,5,19,"And the priest shall cause her to swear, and shall say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou have not gone aside to uncleanness, being under thy husband, be thou free from this water of bitterness that causeth the curse."
4,5,20,"But if thou have gone aside, being under thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee besides thy husband:"
4,5,21,"then the priest shall cause the woman to swear with the oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, Jehovah make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when Jehovah doth make thy thigh to fall away, and thy body to swell;"
4,5,22,"and this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, and make thy body to swell, and thy thigh to fall away. And the woman shall say, Amen, Amen."
4,5,23,"And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out into the water of bitterness:"
4,5,24,"and he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that causeth the curse; and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her `and become' bitter."
4,5,25,"And the priest shall take the meal-offering of jealousy out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the meal-offering before Jehovah, and bring it unto the altar:"
4,5,26,"and the priest shall take a handful of the meal-offering, as the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall make the woman drink the water."
4,5,27,"And when he hath made her drink the water, then it shall come to pass, if she be defiled, and have committed a trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her `and become' bitter, and her body shall swell, and her thigh shall fall away: and the woman shall be a curse among her people."
4,5,28,"And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed."
4,5,29,"This is the law of jealousy, when a wife, being under her husband, goeth aside, and is defiled;"
4,5,30,"or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon a man, and he is jealous of his wife; then shall he set the woman before Jehovah, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law."
4,5,31,"And the man shall be free from iniquity, and that woman shall bear her iniquity."
4,6,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,6,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman shall make a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself unto Jehovah,"
4,6,3,"he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any juice of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried."
4,6,4,"All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the grape-vine, from the kernels even to the husk."
4,6,5,"All the days of his vow of separation there shall no razor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in which he separateth himself unto Jehovah, he shall be holy; he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long."
4,6,6,"All the days that he separateth himself unto Jehovah he shall not come near to a dead body."
4,6,7,"He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die; because his separation unto God is upon his head."
4,6,8,"All the days of his separation he is holy unto Jehovah."
4,6,9,"And if any man die very suddenly beside him, and he defile the head of his separation; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it."
4,6,10,"And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting:"
4,6,11,"and the priest shall offer one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, and make atonement for him, for that he sinned by reason of the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day."
4,6,12,"And he shall separate unto Jehovah the days of his separation, and shall bring a he-lamb a year old for a trespass-offering; but the former days shall be void, because his separation was defiled."
4,6,13,"And this is the law of the Nazirite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the tent of meeting:"
4,6,14,"and he shall offer his oblation unto Jehovah, one he-lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt-offering, and one ewe-lamb a year old without blemish for a sin-offering, and one ram without blemish for peace-offerings,"
4,6,15,"and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings."
4,6,16,"And the priest shall present them before Jehovah, and shall offer his sin-offering, and his burnt-offering:"
4,6,17,"and he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof."
4,6,18,"And the Nazirite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tent of meeting, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace-offerings."
4,6,19,"And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazirite, after he hath shaven `the head of' his separation;"
4,6,20,"and the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before Jehovah; this is holy for the priest, together with the wave-breast and heave-thigh: and after that the Nazirite may drink wine."
4,6,21,"This is the law of the Nazirite who voweth, `and of' his oblation unto Jehovah for his separation, besides that which he is able to get: according to his vow which he voweth, so he must do after the law of his separation."
4,6,22,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,6,23,"Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel: ye shall say unto them,"
4,6,24,"Jehovah bless thee, and keep thee:"
4,6,25,"Jehovah make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:"
4,6,26,"Jehovah lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace."
4,6,27,"So shall they put my name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them."
4,7,1,"And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it, and all the furniture thereof, and the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them and sanctified them;"
4,7,2,"that the princes of Israel, the heads of their fathers' houses, offered. These were the princes of the tribes, these are they that were over them that were numbered:"
4,7,3,"and they brought their oblation before Jehovah, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for every two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they presented them before the tabernacle."
4,7,4,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,7,5,"Take it of them, that they may be `used' in doing the service of the tent of meeting; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according to his service."
4,7,6,"And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites."
4,7,7,"Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according to their service:"
4,7,8,"and four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest."
4,7,9,"But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none, because the service of the sanctuary belonged unto them; they bare it upon their shoulders."
4,7,10,"And the princes offered for the dedication of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes offered their oblation before the altar."
4,7,11,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, They shall offer their oblation, each prince on his day, for the dedication of the altar."
4,7,12,"And he that offered his oblation the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah:"
4,7,13,"and his oblation was one silver platter, the weight whereof was a hundred and thirty `shekels', one silver bowl of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary; both of them full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering;"

4,8,16,"For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel; instead of all that openeth the womb, even the first-born of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me."
4,8,17,"For all the first-born among the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself."

4,8,23,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,8,24,"This is that which belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service in the work of the tent of meeting:"
4,8,25,"and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the work, and shall serve no more,"
4,8,26,"but shall minister with their brethren in the tent of meeting, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charges."
4,9,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,"
4,9,2,"Moreover let the children of Israel keep the passover in its appointed season."
4,9,3,"In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in its appointed season: according to all the statutes of it, and according to all the ordinances thereof, shall ye keep it."
4,9,4,"And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover."
4,9,5,"And they kept the passover in the first `month', on the fourteenth day of the month, at even, in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel."
4,9,6,"And there were certain men, who were unclean by reason of the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:"
4,9,7,"and those men said unto him, We are unclean by reason of the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer the oblation of Jehovah in its appointed season among the children of Israel?"
4,9,8,"And Moses said unto them, Stay ye, that I may hear what Jehovah will command concerning you."
4,9,9,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,9,10,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your generations shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be on a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto Jehovah."
4,9,11,"In the second month on the fourteenth day at even they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs:"
4,9,12,"they shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break a bone thereof: according to all the statute of the passover they shall keep it."
4,9,13,"But the man that is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people; because he offered not the oblation of Jehovah in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin."
4,9,14,"And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto Jehovah; according to the statute of the passover, and according to the ordinance thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one statute, both for the sojourner, and for him that is born in the land."
4,9,15,"And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony: and at even it was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until morning."
4,9,16,"So it was alway: the cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night."
4,9,17,"And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel encamped."
4,9,18,"At the commandment of Jehovah the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of Jehovah they encamped: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they remained encamped."
4,9,19,"And when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of Jehovah, and journeyed not."
4,9,20,"And sometimes the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; then according to the commandment of Jehovah they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of Jehovah they journeyed."
4,9,21,"And sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they journeyed: or `if it continued' by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed."
4,9,22,"Whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, abiding thereon, the children of Israel remained encamped, and journeyed not; but when it was taken up, they journeyed."
4,9,23,"At the commandment of Jehovah they encamped, and at the commandment of Jehovah they journeyed: they kept the charge of Jehovah, at the commandment of Jehovah by Moses."
4,10,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,10,2,"Make thee two trumpets of silver; of beaten work shalt thou make them: and thou shalt use them for the calling of the congregation, and for the journeying of the camps."
4,10,3,"And when they shall blow them, all the congregation shall gather themselves unto thee at the door of the tent of meeting."
4,10,4,"And if they blow but one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee."
4,10,5,"And when ye blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall take their journey."
4,10,6,"And when ye blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys."
4,10,7,"But when the assembly is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm."
4,10,8,"And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; and they shall be to you for a statute for ever throughout your generations."
4,10,9,"And when ye go to war in your land against the adversary that oppresseth you, then ye shall sound an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before Jehovah your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies."
4,10,10,"Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow the trumpets over your burnt-offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God: I am Jehovah your God."
4,10,11,"And it came to pass in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, that the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony."
4,10,12,"And the children of Israel set forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud abode in the wilderness of Paran."
4,10,13,"And they first took their journey according to the commandment of Jehovah by Moses."
4,10,14,"And in the first `place' the standard of the camp of the children of Judah set forward according to their hosts: and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab."
4,10,15,"And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar."
4,10,16,"And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon."
4,10,17,"And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who bare the tabernacle, set forward."
4,10,18,"And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their hosts: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur."
4,10,19,"And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai."
4,10,20,"And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel."
4,10,21,"And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and `the others' did set up the tabernacle against their coming."
4,10,22,"And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their hosts: and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud."
4,10,23,"And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur."
4,10,24,"And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni."
4,10,25,"And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan, which was the rearward of all the camps, set forward according to their hosts: and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai."
4,10,26,"And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ochran."
4,10,27,"And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan."
4,10,28,"Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their hosts; and they set forward."
4,10,29,"And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, We are journeying unto the place of which Jehovah said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good; for Jehovah hath spoken good concerning Israel."
4,10,30,"And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred."
4,10,31,"And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou shalt be to us instead of eyes."
4,10,32,"And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what good soever Jehovah shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee."
4,10,33,"And they set forward from the mount of Jehovah three days' journey; and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went before them three days' journey, to seek out a resting-place for them."
4,10,34,"And the cloud of Jehovah was over them by day, when they set forward from the camp."
4,10,35,"And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, O Jehovah, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee."
4,10,36,"And when it rested, he said, Return, O Jehovah, unto the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel."
4,11,1,"And the people were as murmurers, `speaking' evil in the ears of Jehovah: and when Jehovah heard it, his anger was kindled; and the fire of Jehovah burnt among them, and devoured in the uttermost part of the camp."
4,11,2,"And the people cried unto Moses; and Moses prayed unto Jehovah, and the fire abated."
4,11,3,"And the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of Jehovah burnt among them."
4,11,4,"And the mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?"
4,11,5,"We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt for nought; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic:"
4,11,6,"but now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all save this manna to look upon."
4,11,7,"And the manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance thereof as the appearance of bdellium."
4,11,8,"The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil."
4,11,9,"And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it."
4,11,10,"And Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased."
4,11,11,"And Moses said unto Jehovah, Wherefore hast thou dealt ill with thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?"
4,11,12,"Have I conceived all this people? have I brought them forth, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father carrieth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?"
4,11,13,"Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat."
4,11,14,"I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me."
4,11,15,"And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favor in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness."
4,11,16,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with thee."
4,11,17,"And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone."
4,11,18,"And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore Jehovah will give you flesh, and ye shall eat."
4,11,19,"Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days,"
4,11,20,"but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you; because that ye have rejected Jehovah who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?"
4,11,21,"And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month."
4,11,22,"Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?"
4,11,23,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Is Jehovah's hand waxed short? now shalt thou see whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not."
4,11,24,"And Moses went out, and told the people the words of Jehovah: and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the Tent."
4,11,25,"And Jehovah came down in the cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did so no more."
4,11,26,"But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the Spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but had not gone out unto the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp."
4,11,27,"And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp."
4,11,28,"And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them."
4,11,29,"And Moses said unto him, Art thou jealous for my sake? would that all Jehovah's people were prophets, that Jehovah would put his Spirit upon them!"
4,11,30,"And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel."
4,11,31,"And there went forth a wind from Jehovah, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day's journey on this side, and a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth."
4,11,32,"And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp."
4,11,33,"While the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the people, and Jehovah smote the people with a very great plague."
4,11,34,"And the name of that place was called Kibrothhattaavah, because there they buried the people that lusted."
4,11,35,"From Kibrothhattaavah the people journeyed unto Hazeroth; and they abode at Hazeroth."
4,12,1,"And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman."
4,12,2,"And they said, Hath Jehovah indeed spoken only with Moses? hath he not spoken also with us? And Jehovah heard it."
4,12,3,"Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men that were upon the face of the earth."
4,12,4,"And Jehovah spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tent of meeting. And they three came out."
4,12,5,"And Jehovah came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forth."
4,12,6,"And he said, Hear now my words: if there be a prophet among you, I Jehovah will make myself known unto him in a vision, I will speak with him in a dream."
4,12,7,"My servant Moses is not so; he is faithful in all my house:"
4,12,8,"with him will I speak mouth to mouth, even manifestly, and not in dark speeches; and the form of Jehovah shall he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?"
4,12,9,"And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against them; and he departed."
4,12,10,"And the cloud removed from over the Tent; and, behold, Miriam was leprous, as `white as' snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous."
4,12,11,"And Aaron said unto Moses, Oh, my lord, lay not, I pray thee, sin upon us, for that we have done foolishly, and for that we have sinned."
4,12,12,"Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb."
4,12,13,"And Moses cried unto Jehovah, saying, Heal her, O God, I beseech thee."
4,12,14,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut up without the camp seven days, and after that she shall be brought in again."
4,12,15,"And Miriam was shut up without the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again."
4,12,16,"And afterward the people journeyed from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran."
4,13,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,13,2,"Send thou men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a prince among them."
4,13,3,"And Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of Jehovah: all of them men who were heads of the children of Israel."
4,13,4,"And these were their names: Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur."
4,13,5,"Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori."
4,13,6,"Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh."
4,13,7,"Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph."
4,13,8,"Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun."
4,13,9,"Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu."
4,13,10,"Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi."
4,13,11,"Of the tribe of Joseph, `namely', of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi."
4,13,12,"Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli."
4,13,13,"Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael."
4,13,14,"Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi."
4,13,15,"Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi."
4,13,16,"These are the names of the men that Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua."
4,13,17,"And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this way by the South, and go up into the hill-country:"
4,13,18,"and see the land, what it is; and the people that dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many;"
4,13,19,"and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds;"
4,13,20,"and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there is wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes."
4,13,21,"So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath."
4,13,22,"And they went up by the South, and came unto Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)"
4,13,23,"And they came unto the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it upon a staff between two; `they brought' also of the pomegranates, and of the figs."
4,13,24,"That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from thence."
4,13,25,"And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days."
4,13,26,"And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land."
4,13,27,"And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us; and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it."
4,13,28,"Howbeit the people that dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified, `and' very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there."
4,13,29,"Amalek dwelleth in the land of the South: and the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the hill-country; and the Canaanite dwelleth by the sea, and along by the side of the Jordan."
4,13,30,"And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it."
4,13,31,"But the men that went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we."
4,13,32,"And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature."
4,13,33,"And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight."
4,14,1,"And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night."
4,14,2,"And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would that we had died in this wilderness!"
4,14,3,"And wherefore doth Jehovah bring us unto this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be a prey: were it not better for us to return into Egypt?"
4,14,4,"And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt."
4,14,5,"Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel."
4,14,6,"And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of them that spied out the land, rent their clothes:"
4,14,7,"and they spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceeding good land."
4,14,8,"If Jehovah delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it unto us; a land which floweth with milk and honey."
4,14,9,"Only rebel not against Jehovah, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is removed from over them, and Jehovah is with us: fear them not."
4,14,10,"But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of Jehovah appeared in the tent of meeting unto all the children of Israel."
4,14,11,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, How long will this people despise me? and how long will they not believe in me, for all the signs which I have wrought among them?"
4,14,12,"I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a nation greater and mightier than they."
4,14,13,"And Moses said unto Jehovah, Then the Egyptians will hear it; for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;"
4,14,14,"and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that thou Jehovah art in the midst of this people; for thou Jehovah art seen face to face, and thy cloud standeth over them, and thou goest before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night."
4,14,15,"Now if thou shalt kill this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,"
4,14,16,"Because Jehovah was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness."
4,14,17,"And now, I pray thee, let the power of the Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,"
4,14,18,"Jehovah is slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression; and that will by no means clear `the guilty', visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation."
4,14,19,"Pardon, I pray thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy lovingkindness, and according as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now."
4,14,20,"And Jehovah said, I have pardoned according to thy word:"
4,14,21,"but in very deed, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of Jehovah;"
4,14,22,"because all those men that have seen my glory, and my signs, which I wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tempted me these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;"
4,14,23,"surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that despised me see it:"
4,14,24,"but my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it."
4,14,25,"Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley: to-morrow turn ye, and get you into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea."
4,14,26,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,"
4,14,27,"How long `shall I bear' with this evil congregation, that murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me."
4,14,28,"Say unto them, As I live, saith Jehovah, surely as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:"
4,14,29,"your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, that have murmured against me,"
4,14,30,"surely ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware that I would make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun."
4,14,31,"But your little ones, that ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have rejected."
4,14,32,"But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness."
4,14,33,"And your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your whoredoms, until your dead bodies be consumed in the wilderness."
4,14,34,"After the number of the days in which ye spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my alienation."
4,14,35,"I, Jehovah, have spoken, surely this will I do unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die."
4,14,36,"And the men, whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land,"
4,14,37,"even those men that did bring up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before Jehovah."
4,14,38,"But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, remained alive of those men that went to spy out the land."
4,14,39,"And Moses told these words unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly."
4,14,40,"And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up to the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we are here, and will go up unto the place which Jehovah hath promised: for we have sinned."
4,14,41,"And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of Jehovah, seeing it shall not prosper?"
4,14,42,"Go not up, for Jehovah is not among you; that ye be not smitten down before your enemies."
4,14,43,"For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned back from following Jehovah, therefore Jehovah will not be with you."
4,14,44,"But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and Moses, departed not out of the camp."
4,14,45,"Then the Amalekite came down, and the Canaanite who dwelt in that mountain, and smote them and beat them down, even unto Hormah."
4,15,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,15,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you,"
4,15,3,"and will make an offering by fire unto Jehovah, a burnt-offering, or a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or as a freewill-offering, or in your set feasts, to make a sweet savor unto Jehovah, of the herd, or of the flock;"
4,15,4,"then shall he that offereth his oblation offer unto Jehovah a meal-offering of a tenth part `of an ephah' of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of oil:"
4,15,5,"and wine for the drink-offering, the fourth part of a hin, shalt thou prepare with the burnt-offering, or for the sacrifice, for each lamb."
4,15,6,"Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meal-offering two tenth parts `of an ephah' of fine flour mingled with the third part of a hin of oil:"
4,15,7,"and for the drink-offering thou shalt offer the third part of a hin of wine, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah."
4,15,8,"And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt-offering, or for a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or for peace-offerings unto Jehovah;"
4,15,9,"then shall he offer with the bullock a meal-offering of three tenth parts `of an ephah' of fine flour mingled with half a hin of oil:"
4,15,10,"and thou shalt offer for the drink-offering half a hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah."
4,15,11,"Thus shall it be done for each bullock, or for each ram, or for each of the he-lambs, or of the kids."
4,15,12,"According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number."
4,15,13,"All that are home-born shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah."
4,15,14,"And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever may be among you throughout your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah; as ye do, so he shall do."
4,15,15,"For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth `with you', a statute for ever throughout your generations: as ye are, so shall the sojourner be before Jehovah."
4,15,16,"One law and one ordinance shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you."
4,15,17,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,15,18,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you,"
4,15,19,"then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up a heave-offering unto Jehovah."
4,15,20,"Of the first of your dough ye shall offer up a cake for a heave-offering: as the heave-offering of the threshing-floor, so shall ye heave it."
4,15,21,"Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto Jehovah a heave-offering throughout your generations."
4,15,22,"And when ye shall err, and not observe all these commandments, which Jehovah hath spoken unto Moses,"
4,15,23,"even all that Jehovah hath commanded you by Moses, from the day that Jehovah gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations;"
4,15,24,"then it shall be, if it be done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt-offering, for a sweet savor unto Jehovah, with the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof, according to the ordinance, and one he-goat for a sin-offering."
4,15,25,"And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their oblation, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, and their sin-offering before Jehovah, for their error:"
4,15,26,"and all the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; for in respect of all the people it was done unwittingly."
4,15,27,"And if one person sin unwittingly, then he shall offer a she-goat a year old for a sin-offering."
4,15,28,"And the priest shall make atonement for the soul that erreth, when he sinneth unwittingly, before Jehovah, to make atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven."
4,15,29,"Ye shall have one law for him that doeth aught unwittingly, for him that is home-born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them."
4,15,30,"But the soul that doeth aught with a high hand, whether he be home-born or a sojourner, the same blasphemeth Jehovah; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people."
4,15,31,"Because he hath despised the word of Jehovah, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him."
4,15,32,"And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks upon the sabbath day."
4,15,33,"And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation."
4,15,34,"And they put him in ward, because it had not been declared what should be done to him."
4,15,35,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, The man shall surely be put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp."
4,15,36,"And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him to death with stones; as Jehovah commanded Moses."
4,15,37,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,15,38,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of each border a cord of blue:"
4,15,39,"and it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of Jehovah, and do them; and that ye follow not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to play the harlot;"
4,15,40,"that ye may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God."
4,15,41,"I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Jehovah your God."
4,16,1,"Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took `men':"
4,16,2,"and they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown;"
4,16,3,"and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and Jehovah is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the assembly of Jehovah?"
4,16,4,"And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:"
4,16,5,"and he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, In the morning Jehovah will show who are his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he shall choose will he cause to come near unto him."
4,16,6,"This do: take you censers, Korah, and all his company;"
4,16,7,"and put fire in them, and put incense upon them before Jehovah to-morrow: and it shall be that the man whom Jehovah doth choose, he `shall be' holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi."
4,16,8,"And Moses said unto Korah, Hear now, ye sons of Levi:"
4,16,9,"`seemeth it but' a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of Jehovah, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them;"
4,16,10,"and that he hath brought thee near, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee? and seek ye the priesthood also?"
4,16,11,"Therefore thou and all thy company are gathered together against Jehovah: and Aaron, what is he that ye murmur against him?"
4,16,12,"And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said, We will not come up:"
4,16,13,"is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but thou must needs make thyself also a prince over us?"
4,16,14,"Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up."
4,16,15,"And Moses was very wroth, and said unto Jehovah, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them."
4,16,16,"And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before Jehovah, thou, and they, and Aaron, to-morrow:"
4,16,17,"and take ye every man his censer, and put incense upon them, and bring ye before Jehovah every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each his censer."
4,16,18,"And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood at the door of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron."
4,16,19,"And Korah assembled all the congregation against them unto the door of the tent of meeting: and the glory of Jehovah appeared unto all the congregation."
4,16,20,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,"
4,16,21,"Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment."
4,16,22,"And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?"
4,16,23,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,16,24,"Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram."
4,16,25,"And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him."
4,16,26,"And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins."
4,16,27,"So they gat them up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little ones."
4,16,28,"And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that Jehovah hath sent me to do all these works; for `I have' not `done them' of mine own mind."
4,16,29,"If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then Jehovah hath not sent me."
4,16,30,"But if Jehovah make a new thing, and the ground open its mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down alive into Sheol; then ye shall understand that these men have despised Jehovah."
4,16,31,"And it came to pass, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them;"
4,16,32,"and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods."
4,16,33,"So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into Sheol: and the earth closed upon them, and they perished from among the assembly."
4,16,34,"And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them; for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up."
4,16,35,"And fire came forth from Jehovah, and devoured the two hundred and fifty men that offered the incense."
4,16,36,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,16,37,"Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are holy,"
4,16,38,"even the censers of these sinners against their own lives; and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before Jehovah; therefore they are holy; and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel."
4,16,39,"And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, which they that were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar,"
4,16,40,"to be a memorial unto the children of Israel, to the end that no stranger, that is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to burn incense before Jehovah; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as Jehovah spake unto him by Moses."
4,16,41,"But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of Jehovah."
4,16,42,"And it came to pass, when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tent of meeting: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Jehovah appeared."
4,16,43,"And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting."
4,16,44,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,16,45,"Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. And they fell upon their faces."
4,16,46,"And Moses said unto Aaron, Take they censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and lay incense thereon, and carry it quickly unto the congregation, and make atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from Jehovah; the plague is begun."
4,16,47,"And Aaron took as Moses spake, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people."
4,16,48,"And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed."
4,16,49,"Now they that died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah."
4,16,50,"And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tent of meeting: and the plague was stayed."
4,17,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,17,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of them rods, one for each fathers' house, of all their princes according to their fathers' houses, twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod."
4,17,3,"And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi; for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers' houses."
4,17,4,"And thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you."
4,17,5,"And it shall come to pass, that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall bud: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you."
4,17,6,"And Moses spake unto the children of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods."
4,17,7,"And Moses laid up the rods before Jehovah in the tent of the testimony."
4,17,8,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and produced blossoms, and bare ripe almonds."
4,17,9,"And Moses brought out all the rods from before Jehovah unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod."
4,17,10,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the children of rebellion; that thou mayest make an end of their murmurings against me, that they die not."
4,17,11,"Thus did Moses: as Jehovah commanded him, so did he."
4,17,12,"And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone."
4,17,13,"Every one that cometh near, that cometh near unto the tabernacle of Jehovah, dieth: shall we perish all of us?"
4,18,1,"And Jehovah said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy fathers' house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood."
4,18,2,"And thy brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall be before the tent of the testimony."
4,18,3,"And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the Tent: only they shall not come nigh unto the vessels of the sanctuary and unto the altar, that they die not, neither they, nor ye."
4,18,4,"And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the Tent: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you."
4,18,5,"And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar; that there be wrath no more upon the children of Israel."
4,18,6,"And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are a gift, given unto Jehovah, to do the service of the tent of meeting."
4,18,7,"And thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood for everything of the altar, and for that within the veil; and ye shall serve: I give you the priesthood as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death."
4,18,8,"And Jehovah spake unto Aaron, And I, behold, I have given thee the charge of my heave-offerings, even all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, as a portion for ever."
4,18,9,"This shall be thine of the most holy things, `reserved' from the fire: every oblation of theirs, even every meal-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every trespass-offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons."
4,18,10,"As the most holy things shalt thou eat thereof; every male shall eat thereof: it shall be holy unto thee."
4,18,11,"And this is thine: the heave-offering of their gift, even all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel; I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, as a portion for ever; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof."
4,18,12,"All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first-fruits of them which they give unto Jehovah, to thee have I given them."
4,18,13,"The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring unto Jehovah, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof."
4,18,14,"Everything devoted in Israel shall be thine."
4,18,15,"Everything that openeth the womb, of all flesh which they offer unto Jehovah, both of man and beast shall be thine: nevertheless the first-born of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem."
4,18,16,"And those that are to be redeemed of them from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the same is twenty gerahs)."
4,18,17,"But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savor unto Jehovah."
4,18,18,"And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave-breast and as the right thigh, it shall be thine."
4,18,19,"All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto Jehovah, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, as a portion for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before Jehovah unto thee and to thy seed with thee."
4,18,20,"And Jehovah said unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any portion among them: I am thy portion and thine inheritance among the children of Israel."
4,18,21,"And unto the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the tent of meeting."
4,18,22,"And henceforth the children of Israel shall not come nigh the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin, and die."
4,18,23,"But the Levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations; and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance."
4,18,24,"For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as a heave-offering unto Jehovah, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance."
4,18,25,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,18,26,"Moreover thou shalt speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up a heave-offering of it for Jehovah, a tithe of the tithe."
4,18,27,"And your heave-offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the grain of the threshing-floor, and as the fulness of the winepress."
4,18,28,"Thus ye also shall offer a heave-offering unto Jehovah of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and thereof ye shall give Jehovah's heave-offering to Aaron the priest."
4,18,29,"Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave-offering of Jehovah, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it."
4,18,30,"Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye heave the best thereof from it, then it shall be reckoned unto the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the wine-press."
4,18,31,"And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting."
4,18,32,"And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best thereof: and ye shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that ye die not."
4,19,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,"
4,19,2,"This is the statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, `and' upon which never came yoke."
4,19,3,"And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:"
4,19,4,"and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle her blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times."
4,19,5,"And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:"
4,19,6,"and the priest shall take cedar-wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer."
4,19,7,"Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even."
4,19,8,"And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even."
4,19,9,"And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place; and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water for impurity: it is a sin-offering."
4,19,10,"And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever."
4,19,11,"He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days:"
4,19,12,"the same shall purify himself therewith on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean."
4,19,13,"Whosoever toucheth a dead person, the body of a man that hath died, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of Jehovah; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water for impurity was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him."
4,19,14,"This is the law when a man dieth in a tent: every one that cometh into the tent, and every one that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days."
4,19,15,"And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean."
4,19,16,"And whosoever in the open field toucheth one that is slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days."
4,19,17,"And for the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the sin-offering; and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel:"
4,19,18,"and a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched the bone, or the slain, or the dead, or the grave:"
4,19,19,"and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify him; and he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even."
4,19,20,"But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of Jehovah: the water for impurity hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean."
4,19,21,"And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them: and he that sprinkleth the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and he that toucheth the water for impurity shall be unclean until even."
4,19,22,"And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even."
4,20,1,"And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there."
4,20,2,"And there was no water for the congregation: and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron."
4,20,3,"And the people strove with Moses, and spake, saying, Would that we had died when our brethren died before Jehovah!"
4,20,4,"And why have ye brought the assembly of Jehovah into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our beasts?"
4,20,5,"And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink."
4,20,6,"And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tent of meeting, and fell upon their faces: and the glory of Jehovah appeared unto them."
4,20,7,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,20,8,"Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes, that it give forth its water; and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock; so thou shalt give the congregation and their cattle drink."
4,20,9,"And Moses took the rod from before Jehovah, as he commanded him."
4,20,10,"And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; shall we bring you forth water out of this rock?"
4,20,11,"And Moses lifted up his hand, and smote the rock with his rod twice: and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their cattle."
4,20,12,"And Jehovah said unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed not in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them."
4,20,13,"These are the waters of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with Jehovah, and he was sanctified in them."
4,20,14,"And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:"
4,20,15,"how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and our fathers:"
4,20,16,"and when we cried unto Jehovah, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border."
4,20,17,"Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy land: we will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go along the king's highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy border."
4,20,18,"And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against thee."
4,20,19,"And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go up by the highway; and if we drink of thy water, I and my cattle, then will I give the price thereof: let me only, without `doing' anything `else', pass through on my feet."
4,20,20,"And he said, Thou shalt not pass through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand."
4,20,21,"Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him."
4,20,22,"And they journeyed from Kadesh: and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came unto mount Hor."
4,20,23,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying,"
4,20,24,"Aaron shall be gathered unto his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah."
4,20,25,"Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor;"
4,20,26,"and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered `unto his people', and shall die there."
4,20,27,"And Moses did as Jehovah commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation."
4,20,28,"And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount."
4,20,29,"And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel."
4,21,1,"And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who dwelt in the South, heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim; and he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive."
4,21,2,"And Israel vowed a vow unto Jehovah, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities."
4,21,3,"And Jehovah hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and the name of the place was called Hormah."
4,21,4,"And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way."
4,21,5,"And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loatheth this light bread."
4,21,6,"And Jehovah sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died."
4,21,7,"And the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, because we have spoken against Jehovah, and against thee; pray unto Jehovah, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people."
4,21,8,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a standard: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he seeth it, shall live."
4,21,9,"And Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it upon the standard: and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked unto the serpent of brass, he lived."
4,21,10,"And the children of Israel journeyed, and encamped in Oboth."
4,21,11,"And they journeyed from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising."
4,21,12,"From thence they journeyed, and encamped in the valley of Zered."
4,21,13,"From thence they journeyed, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that cometh out of the border of the Amorites: for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites."
4,21,14,"Wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of Jehovah, Vaheb in Suphah, And the valleys of the Arnon,"
4,21,15,"And the slope of the valleys That inclineth toward the dwelling of Ar, And leaneth upon the border of Moab."
4,21,16,"And from thence `they journeyed' to Beer: that is the well whereof Jehovah said unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water."
4,21,17,"Then sang Israel this song: Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:"
4,21,18,"The well, which the princes digged, Which the nobles of the people delved, With the sceptre, `and' with their staves. And from the wilderness `they journeyed' to Mattanah;"
4,21,19,"and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;"
4,21,20,"and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh down upon the desert."
4,21,21,"And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,"
4,21,22,"Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's highway, until we have passed thy border."
4,21,23,"And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz; and he fought against Israel."
4,21,24,"And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon unto the Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong."
4,21,25,"And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the towns thereof."
4,21,26,"For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto the Arnon."
4,21,27,"Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come ye to Heshbon; Let the city of Sihon be built and established:"
4,21,28,"For a fire is gone out of Heshbon, A flame from the city of Sihon: It hath devoured Ar of Moab, The lords of the high places of the Arnon."
4,21,29,"Woe to thee, Moab! Thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: He hath given his sons as fugitives, And his daughters into captivity, Unto Sihon king of the Amorites."
4,21,30,"We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, And we have laid waste even unto Nophah, Which `reacheth' unto Medeba."
4,21,31,"Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites."
4,21,32,"And Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took the towns thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there."
4,21,33,"And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei."
4,21,34,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon."
4,21,35,"So they smote him, and his sons and all his people, until there was none left him remaining: and they possessed his land."
4,22,1,"And the children of Israel journeyed, and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho."
4,22,2,"And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites."
4,22,3,"And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel."
4,22,4,"And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now will this multitude lick up all that is round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time."
4,22,5,"And he sent messengers unto Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me."
4,22,6,"Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed."
4,22,7,"And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak."
4,22,8,"And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as Jehovah shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam."
4,22,9,"And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?"
4,22,10,"And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, `saying',"
4,22,11,"Behold, the people that is come out of Egypt, it covereth the face of the earth: now, come curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out."
4,22,12,"And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people; for they are blessed."
4,22,13,"And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land; for Jehovah refuseth to give me leave to go with you."
4,22,14,"And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us."
4,22,15,"And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they."
4,22,16,"And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:"
4,22,17,"for I will promote thee unto very great honor, and whatsoever thou sayest unto me I will do: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people."
4,22,18,"And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of Jehovah my God, to do less or more."
4,22,19,"Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what Jehovah will speak unto me more."
4,22,20,"And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men are come to call thee, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak unto thee, that shalt thou do."
4,22,21,"And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab."
4,22,22,"And God's anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of Jehovah placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him."
4,22,23,"And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way."
4,22,24,"Then the angel of Jehovah stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side."
4,22,25,"And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah, and she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again."
4,22,26,"And the angel of Jehovah went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left."
4,22,27,"And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah, and she lay down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with his staff."
4,22,28,"And Jehovah opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?"
4,22,29,"And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me, I would there were a sword in my hand, for now I had killed thee."
4,22,30,"And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden all thy life long unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? and he said, Nay."
4,22,31,"Then Jehovah opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of Jehovah standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face."
4,22,32,"And the angel of Jehovah said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I am come forth for an adversary, because thy way is perverse before me:"
4,22,33,"and the ass saw me, and turned aside before me these three times: unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I had even slain thee, and saved her alive."
4,22,34,"And Balaam said unto the angel of Jehovah, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again."
4,22,35,"And the angel of Jehovah said unto Balaam, Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak."
4,22,36,"And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border."
4,22,37,"And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honor?"
4,22,38,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to speak anything? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak."
4,22,39,"And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kiriath-huzoth."
4,22,40,"And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him."
4,22,41,"And it came to pass in the morning, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal; and he saw from thence the utmost part of the people."
4,23,1,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams."
4,23,2,"And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram."
4,23,3,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt-offering, and I will go: peradventure Jehovah will come to meet me; and whatsoever he showeth me I will tell thee. And he went to a bare height."
4,23,4,"And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar."
4,23,5,"And Jehovah put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak."
4,23,6,"And he returned unto him, and, lo, he was standing by his burnt-offering, he, and all the princes of Moab."
4,23,7,"And he took up his parable, and said, From Aram hath Balak brought me, The king of Moab from the mountains of the East: Come, curse me Jacob, And come, defy Israel."
4,23,8,"How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? And how shall I defy, whom Jehovah hath not defied?"
4,23,9,"For from the top of the rocks I see him, And from the hills I behold him: lo, it is a people that dwelleth alone, And shall not be reckoned among the nations."
4,23,10,"Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, And let my last end be like his!"
4,23,11,"And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether."
4,23,12,"And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which Jehovah putteth in my mouth?"
4,23,13,"And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them; thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence."
4,23,14,"And he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar."
4,23,15,"And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt-offering, while I meet `Jehovah' yonder."
4,23,16,"And Jehovah met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak."
4,23,17,"And he came to him, and, lo, he was standing by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath Jehovah spoken?"
4,23,18,"And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; Hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:"
4,23,19,"God is not a man, that he should lie, Neither the son of man, that he should repent: Hath he said, and will he not do it? Or hath he spoken, and will he not make it good?"
4,23,20,"Behold, I have received `commandment' to bless: And he hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it."
4,23,21,"He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob; Neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: Jehovah his God is with him, And the shout of a king is among them."
4,23,22,"God bringeth them forth out of Egypt; He hath as it were the strength of the wild-ox."
4,23,23,"Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob; Neither is there any divination with Israel: Now shalt it be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!"
4,23,24,"Behold, the people riseth up as a lioness, And as a lion doth he lift himself up: He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, And drink the blood of the slain."
4,23,25,"And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all."
4,23,26,"But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that Jehovah speaketh, that I must do?"
4,23,27,"And Balak said unto Balaam, Come now, I will take thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence."
4,23,28,"And Balak took Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh down upon the desert."
4,23,29,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams."
4,23,30,"And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar."
4,24,1,"And when Balaam saw that it pleased Jehovah to bless Israel, he went not, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness."
4,24,2,"And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came upon him."
4,24,3,"And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor saith, And the man whose eye was closed saith;"
4,24,4,"He saith, who heareth the words of God, Who seeth the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, and having his eyes open:"
4,24,5,"How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, Thy tabernacles, O Israel!"
4,24,6,"As valleys are they spread forth, As gardens by the river-side, As lign-aloes which Jehovah hath planted, As cedar-trees beside the waters."
4,24,7,"Water shall flow from his buckets, And his seed shall be in many waters, And his king shall be higher than Agag, And his kingdom shall be exalted."
4,24,8,"God bringeth him forth out of Egypt; He hath as it were the strength of the wild-ox: He shall eat up the nations his adversaries, And shall break their bones in pieces, And smite `them' through with his arrows."
4,24,9,"He couched, he lay down as a lion, And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up? Blessed be every one that blesseth thee, And cursed be every one that curseth thee."
4,24,10,"And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together; and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times."
4,24,11,"Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honor; but, lo, Jehovah hath kept thee back from honor."
4,24,12,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers that thou sentest unto me, saying,"
4,24,13,"If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of Jehovah, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; what Jehovah speaketh, that will I speak?"
4,24,14,"And now, behold, I go unto my people: come, `and' I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days."
4,24,15,"And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor saith, And the man whose eye was closed saith;"
4,24,16,"He saith, who heareth the words of God, And knoweth the knowledge of the Most High, Who seeth the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, and having his eyes open:"
4,24,17,"I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not nigh: There shall come forth a star out of Jacob, And a sceptre shall rise out of Israel, And shall smite through the corners of Moab, And break down all the sons of tumult."
4,24,18,"And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession, `who were' his enemies; While Israel doeth valiantly."
4,24,19,"And out of Jacob shall one have dominion, And shall destroy the remnant from the city."
4,24,20,"And he looked on Amalek, and took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; But his latter end shall come to destruction."
4,24,21,"And he looked on the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwelling-place, And thy nest is set in the rock."
4,24,22,"Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted, Until Asshur shall carry thee away captive."
4,24,23,"And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this?"
4,24,24,"But ships `shall come' from the coast of Kittim, And they shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber; And he also shall come to destruction."
4,24,25,"And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way."
4,25,1,"And Israel abode in Shittim; and the people began to play the harlot with the daughters of Moab:"
4,25,2,"for they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods; and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods."
4,25,3,"And Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel."
4,25,4,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them up unto Jehovah before the sun, that the fierce anger of Jehovah may turn away from Israel."
4,25,5,"And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that have joined themselves unto Baal-peor."
4,25,6,"And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the tent of meeting."
4,25,7,"And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the midst of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand;"
4,25,8,"and he went after the man of Israel into the pavilion, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her body. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel."
4,25,9,"And those that died by the plague were twenty and four thousand."
4,25,10,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,25,11,"Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy."
4,25,12,"Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:"
4,25,13,"and it shall be unto him, and to his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel."
4,25,14,"Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers' house among the Simeonites."
4,25,15,"And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head of the people of a fathers' house in Midian."
4,25,16,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,25,17,"Vex the Midianites, and smite them;"
4,25,18,"for they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor."
4,26,1,"And it came to pass after the plague, that Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,"
4,26,2,"Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers' houses, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel."
4,26,3,"And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,"
4,26,4,"`Take the sum of the people', from twenty years old and upward; as Jehovah commanded Moses and the children of Israel, that came forth out of the land of Egypt."
4,26,5,"Reuben, the first-born of Israel; the sons of Reuben: `of' Hanoch, the family of the Hanochites; of Pallu, the family of the Palluites;"

4,26,8,"And the sons of Pallu: Eliab."
4,26,9,"And the sons of Eliab: Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram. These are that Dathan and Abiram, who were called of the congregation, who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah, when they strove against Jehovah,"
4,26,10,"and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died; what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men, and they became a sign."

4,27,7,"The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them."
4,27,8,"And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter."
4,27,9,"And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren."
4,27,10,"And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren."
4,27,11,"And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute `and' ordinance, as Jehovah commanded Moses."
4,27,12,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, and behold the land which I have given unto the children of Israel."
4,27,13,"And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered;"
4,27,14,"because ye rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the waters before their eyes. (These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)"
4,27,15,"And Moses spake unto Jehovah, saying,"
4,27,16,"Let Jehovah, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation,"
4,27,17,"who may go out before them, and who may come in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in; that the congregation of Jehovah be not as sheep which have no shepherd."
4,27,18,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay thy hand upon him;"
4,27,19,"and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight."
4,27,20,"And thou shalt put of thine honor upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may obey."
4,27,21,"And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before Jehovah: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation."
4,27,22,"And Moses did as Jehovah commanded him; and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:"
4,27,23,"and he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as Jehovah spake by Moses."
4,28,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,28,2,"Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My oblation, my food for my offerings made by fire, of a sweet savor unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season."
4,28,3,"And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto Jehovah: he-lambs a year old without blemish, two day by day, for a continual burnt-offering."
4,28,4,"The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even;"
4,28,5,"and the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil."
4,28,6,"It is a continual burnt-offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah."
4,28,7,"And the drink-offering thereof shall be the fourth part of a hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou pour out a drink-offering of strong drink unto Jehovah."
4,28,8,"And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meal-offering of the morning, and as the drink-offering thereof, thou shalt offer it, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah."
4,28,9,"And on the sabbath day two he-lambs a year old without blemish, and two tenth parts `of an ephah' of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and the drink-offering thereof:"
4,28,10,"this is the burnt-offering of every sabbath, besides the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof."
4,28,11,"And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt-offering unto Jehovah: two young bullocks, and one ram, seven he-lambs a year old without blemish;"
4,28,12,"and three tenth parts `of an ephah' of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for each bullock; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for the one ram;"
4,28,13,"and a tenth part of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering unto every lamb; for a burnt-offering of a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah."
4,28,14,"And their drink-offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bullock, and the third part of a hin for the ram, and the fourth part of a hin for a lamb: this is the burnt-offering of every month throughout the months of the year."
4,28,15,"And one he-goat for a sin-offering unto Jehovah; it shall be offered besides the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof."
4,28,16,"And in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, is Jehovah's passover."
4,28,17,"And on the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten."
4,28,18,"In the first day shall be a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work;"
4,28,19,"but ye shall offer an offering made by fire, a burnt-offering unto Jehovah: two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven he-lambs a year old; they shall be unto you without blemish;"
4,28,20,"and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil: three tenth parts shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth parts for the ram;"
4,28,21,"a tenth part shalt thou offer for every lamb of the seven lambs;"
4,28,22,"and one he-goat for a sin-offering, to make atonement for you."
4,28,23,"Ye shall offer these besides the burnt-offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt-offering."
4,28,24,"After this manner ye shall offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah: it shall be offered besides the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof."
4,28,25,"And on the seventh day ye shall have a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work."
4,28,26,"Also in the day of the first-fruits, when ye offer a new meal-offering unto Jehovah in your `feast of' weeks, ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work;"
4,28,27,"but ye shall offer a burnt-offering for a sweet savor unto Jehovah: two young bullocks, one ram, seven he-lambs a year old;"
4,28,28,"and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for each bullock, two tenth parts for the one ram,"
4,28,29,"a tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs;"
4,28,30,"one he-goat, to make atonement for you."
4,28,31,"Besides the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering thereof, ye shall offer them (they shall be unto you without blemish), and their drink-offerings."
4,29,1,"And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work: it is a day of blowing of trumpets unto you."
4,29,2,"And ye shall offer a burnt-offering for a sweet savor unto Jehovah: one young bullock, one ram, seven he-lambs a year old without blemish;"
4,29,3,"and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for the bullock, two tenth parts for the ram,"
4,29,4,"and one tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs;"
4,29,5,"and one he-goat for a sin-offering, to make atonement for you;"
4,29,6,"besides the burnt-offering of the new moon, and the meal-offering thereof, and the continual burnt-offering and the meal-offering thereof, and their drink-offerings, according unto their ordinance, for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah."
4,29,7,"And on the tenth day of this seventh month ye shall have a holy convocation; and ye shall afflict your souls: ye shall do no manner of work;"
4,29,8,"but ye shall offer a burnt-offering unto Jehovah for a sweet savor: one young bullock, one ram, seven he-lambs a year old; they shall be unto you without blemish;"
4,29,9,"and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for the bullock, two tenth parts for the one ram,"
4,29,10,"a tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs:"
4,29,11,"one he-goat for a sin-offering; besides the sin-offering of atonement, and the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering thereof, and their drink-offerings."
4,29,12,"And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work, and ye shall keep a feast unto Jehovah seven days:"
4,29,13,"and ye shall offer a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah; thirteen young bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old; they shall be without blemish;"
4,29,14,"and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for every bullock of the thirteen bullocks, two tenth parts for each ram of the two rams,"
4,29,15,"and a tenth part for every lamb of the fourteen lambs;"
4,29,16,"and one he-goat for a sin-offering, besides the continual burnt-offering, the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof."
4,29,17,"And on the second day `ye shall offer' twelve young bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old without blemish;"
4,29,18,"and their meal-offering and their drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, after the ordinance;"
4,29,19,"and one he-goat for a sin-offering; besides the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering thereof, and their drink-offerings."
4,29,20,"And on the third day eleven bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old without blemish;"
4,29,21,"and their meal-offering and their drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, after the ordinance;"
4,29,22,"and one he-goat for a sin-offering; besides the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof."
4,29,23,"And on the fourth day ten bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old without blemish;"
4,29,24,"their meal-offering and their drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, after the ordinance;"
4,29,25,"and one he-goat for a sin-offering; besides the continual burnt-offering, the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof."
4,29,26,"And on the fifth day nine bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old without blemish;"
4,29,27,"and their meal-offering and their drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, after the ordinance;"
4,29,28,"and one he-goat for a sin-offering, besides the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof."
4,29,29,"And on the sixth day eight bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old without blemish;"
4,29,30,"and their meal-offering and their drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, after the ordinance;"
4,29,31,"and one he-goat for a sin-offering; besides the continual burnt-offering, the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offerings thereof."
4,29,32,"And on the seventh day seven bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old without blemish;"
4,29,33,"and their meal-offering and their drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, after the ordinance;"
4,29,34,"and one he-goat for a sin-offering; besides the continual burnt-offering, the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof."
4,29,35,"On the eighth day ye shall have a solemn assembly: ye shall do no servile work;"
4,29,36,"but ye shall offer a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah: one bullock, one ram, seven he-lambs a year old without blemish;"
4,29,37,"their meal-offering and their drink-offerings for the bullock, for the ram, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the ordinance:"
4,29,38,"and one he-goat for a sin-offering, besides the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof."
4,29,39,"These ye shall offer unto Jehovah in your set feasts, besides your vows, and your freewill-offerings, for your burnt-offerings, and for your meal-offerings, and for your drink-offerings, and for your peace-offerings."
4,29,40,"And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses."
4,30,1,"And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded."
4,30,2,"When a man voweth a vow unto Jehovah, or sweareth an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth."
4,30,3,"Also when a woman voweth a vow unto Jehovah, and bindeth herself by a bond, being in her father's house, in her youth,"
4,30,4,"and her father heareth her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father holdeth his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand."
4,30,5,"But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth, none of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and Jehovah will forgive her, because her father disallowed her."
4,30,6,"And if she be `married' to a husband, while her vows are upon her, or the rash utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul,"
4,30,7,"and her husband hear it, and hold his peace at her in the day that he heareth it; then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand."
4,30,8,"But if her husband disallow her in the day that he heareth it, then he shall make void her vow which is upon her, and the rash utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul: and Jehovah will forgive her."
4,30,9,"But the vow of a widow, or of her that is divorced, `even' everything wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand against her."
4,30,10,"And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath,"
4,30,11,"and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand."
4,30,12,"But if her husband made them null and void in the day that he heard them, then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and Jehovah will forgive her."
4,30,13,"Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void."
4,30,14,"But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day, then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he hath established them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them."
4,30,15,"But if he shall make them null and void after that he hath heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity."
4,30,16,"These are the statutes, which Jehovah commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, being in her youth, in her father's house."
4,31,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,31,2,"Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people."
4,31,3,"And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm ye men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute Jehovah's vengeance on Midian."
4,31,4,"Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war."
4,31,5,"So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war."
4,31,6,"And Moses sent them, a thousand of every tribe, to the war, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand."
4,31,7,"And they warred against Midian, as Jehovah commanded Moses; and they slew every male."
4,31,8,"And they slew the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain: Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword."
4,31,9,"And the children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones; and all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods, they took for a prey."
4,31,10,"And all their cities in the places wherein they dwelt, and all their encampments, they burnt with fire."
4,31,11,"And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of man and of beast."
4,31,12,"And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and unto Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan at Jericho."
4,31,13,"And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp."
4,31,14,"And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war."
4,31,15,"And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?"
4,31,16,"Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against Jehovah in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was among the congregation of Jehovah."
4,31,17,"Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him."
4,31,18,"But all the women-children, that have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves."
4,31,19,"And encamp ye without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, ye and your captives."
4,31,20,"And as to every garment, and all that is made of skin, and all work of goats' `hair', and all things made of wood, ye shall purify yourselves."
4,31,21,"And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war that went to the battle, This is the statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded Moses:"
4,31,22,"howbeit the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,"
4,31,23,"everything that may abide the fire, ye shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with the water for impurity: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make to go through the water."
4,31,24,"And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean; and afterward ye shall come into the camp."
4,31,25,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,31,26,"Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers' `houses' of the congregation;"
4,31,27,"and divide the prey into two parts: between the men skilled in war, that went out to battle, and all the congregation."
4,31,28,"And levy a tribute unto Jehovah of the men of war that went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, `both' of the persons, and of the oxen, and of the asses, and of the flocks:"
4,31,29,"take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for Jehovah's heave-offering."
4,31,30,"And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the oxen, of the asses, and of the flocks, `even' of all the cattle, and give them unto the Levites, that keep the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah."
4,31,31,"And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as Jehovah commanded Moses."
4,31,32,"Now the prey, over and above the booty which the men of war took, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,"
4,31,33,"and threescore and twelve thousand oxen,"
4,31,34,"and threescore and one thousand asses,"
4,31,35,"and thirty and two thousand persons in all, of the women that had not known man by lying with him."
4,31,36,"And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep:"
4,31,37,"and Jehovah's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen."
4,31,38,"And the oxen were thirty and six thousand; of which Jehovah's tribute was threescore and twelve."
4,31,39,"And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which Jehovah's tribute was threescore and one."
4,31,40,"And the persons were sixteen thousand; of whom Jehovah's tribute was thirty and two persons."
4,31,41,"And Moses gave the tribute, which was Jehovah's heave-offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as Jehovah commanded Moses."
4,31,42,"And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided off from the men that warred,"
4,31,43,"(now the congregation's half was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand, seven thousand and five hundred sheep,"
4,31,44,"and thirty and six thousand oxen,"
4,31,45,"and thirty thousand and five hundred asses,"
4,31,46,"and sixteen thousand persons),"
4,31,47,"even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, that kept the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses."
4,31,48,"And the officers that were over the thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses;"
4,31,49,"and they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war that are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us."
4,31,50,"And we have brought Jehovah's oblation, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, ankle-chains, and bracelets, signet-rings, ear-rings, and armlets, to make atonement for our souls before Jehovah."
4,31,51,"And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels."
4,31,52,"And all the gold of the heave-offering that they offered up to Jehovah, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels."
4,31,53,"(`For' the men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.)"
4,31,54,"And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting, for a memorial for the children of Israel before Jehovah."
4,32,1,"Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;"
4,32,2,"the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying,"
4,32,3,"Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon,"
4,32,4,"the land which Jehovah smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle; and thy servants have cattle."
4,32,5,"And they said, If we have found favor in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession; bring us not over the Jordan."
4,32,6,"And Moses said unto the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to the war, and shall ye sit here?"
4,32,7,"And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which Jehovah hath given them?"
4,32,8,"Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land."
4,32,9,"For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which Jehovah had given them."
4,32,10,"And Jehovah's anger was kindled in that day, and he sware, saying,"
4,32,11,"Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:"
4,32,12,"save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun; because they have wholly followed Jehovah."
4,32,13,"And Jehovah's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander to and fro in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of Jehovah, was consumed."
4,32,14,"And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of Jehovah toward Israel."
4,32,15,"For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye will destroy all this people."
4,32,16,"And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:"
4,32,17,"but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land."
4,32,18,"We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance."
4,32,19,"For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan, and forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward."
4,32,20,"And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will arm yourselves to go before Jehovah to the war,"
4,32,21,"and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before Jehovah, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,"
4,32,22,"and the land is subdued before Jehovah; then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless towards Jehovah, and towards Israel; and this land shall be unto you for a possession before Jehovah."
4,32,23,"But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against Jehovah; and be sure your sin will find you out."
4,32,24,"Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth."
4,32,25,"And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth."
4,32,26,"Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead;"
4,32,27,"but thy servants will pass over, every man that is armed for war, before Jehovah to battle, as my lord saith."
4,32,28,"So Moses gave charge concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers' `houses' of the tribes of the children of Israel."
4,32,29,"And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man that is armed to battle, before Jehovah, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:"
4,32,30,"but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan."
4,32,31,"And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As Jehovah hath said unto thy servants, so will we do."
4,32,32,"We will pass over armed before Jehovah into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance `shall remain' with us beyond the Jordan."
4,32,33,"And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, according to the cities thereof with `their' borders, even the cities of the land round about."
4,32,34,"And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,"
4,32,35,"and Atrothshophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah,"
4,32,36,"and Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran: fortified cities, and folds for sheep."
4,32,37,"And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim,"
4,32,38,"and Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and Sibmah: and they gave other names unto the cities which they builded."
4,32,39,"And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites that were therein."
4,32,40,"And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein."
4,32,41,"And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the towns thereof, and called them Havvoth-jair."

4,33,3,"And they journeyed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians,"

4,33,49,"And they encamped by the Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth even unto Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab."
4,33,50,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,"
4,33,51,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,"
4,33,52,"then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their figured `stones', and destroy all their molten images, and demolish all their high places:"
4,33,53,"and ye shall take possession of the land, and dwell therein; for unto you have I given the land to possess it."
4,33,54,"And ye shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance: wheresoever the lot falleth to any man, that shall be his; according to the tribes of your fathers shall ye inherit."
4,33,55,"But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then shall those that ye let remain of them be as pricks in your eyes, and as thorns in your sides, and they shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell."
4,33,56,"And it shall come to pass, that, as I thought to do unto them, so will I do unto you."
4,34,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,34,2,"Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan according to the borders thereof),"
4,34,3,"then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the side of Edom, and your south border shall be from the end of the Salt Sea eastward;"
4,34,4,"and your border shall turn about southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass along to Zin; and the goings out thereof shall be southward of Kadesh-barnea; and it shall go forth to Hazar-addar, and pass along to Azmon;"
4,34,5,"and the border shall turn about from Azmon unto the brook of Egypt, and the goings out thereof shall be at the sea."
4,34,6,"And for the western border, ye shall have the great sea and the border `thereof': this shall be your west border."
4,34,7,"And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall mark out for you mount Hor;"
4,34,8,"from mount Hor ye shall mark out unto the entrance of Hamath; and the goings out of the border shall be at Zedad;"
4,34,9,"and the border shall go forth to Ziphron, and the goings out thereof shall be at Hazar-enan: this shall be your north border."
4,34,10,"And ye shall mark out your east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham;"
4,34,11,"and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go down, and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward;"
4,34,12,"and the border shall go down to the Jordan, and the goings out thereof shall be at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land according to the borders thereof round about."
4,34,13,"And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which Jehovah hath commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half-tribe;"
4,34,14,"for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their fathers' houses, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to their fathers' houses, have received, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received, their inheritance:"
4,34,15,"the two tribes and the half-tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising."
4,34,16,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,34,17,"These are the names of the men that shall divide the land unto you for inheritance: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun."
4,34,18,"And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land for inheritance."
4,34,19,"And these are the names of the men: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh."
4,34,20,"And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud."
4,34,21,"Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon."
4,34,22,"And of the tribe of the children of Dan a prince, Bukki the son of Jogli."
4,34,23,"Of the children of Joseph: of the tribe of the children of Manasseh a prince, Hanniel the son of Ephod."
4,34,24,"And of the tribe of the children of Ephraim a prince, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan."
4,34,25,"And of the tribe of the children of Zebulun a prince, Elizaphan the son of Parnach."
4,34,26,"And of the tribe of the children of Issachar a prince, Paltiel the son of Azzan."
4,34,27,"And of the tribe of the children of Asher a prince, Ahihud the son of Shelomi."
4,34,28,"And of the tribe of the children of Naphtali a prince, Pedahel the son of Ammihud."
4,34,29,"These are they whom Jehovah commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan."
4,35,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,"
4,35,2,"Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and suburbs for the cities round about them shall ye give unto the Levites."
4,35,3,"And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and their suburbs shall be for their cattle, and for their substance, and for all their beasts."
4,35,4,"And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall be from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about."
4,35,5,"And ye shall measure without the city for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the midst. This shall be to them the suburbs of the cities."
4,35,6,"And the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites, they shall be the six cities of refuge, which ye shall give for the manslayer to flee unto: and besides them ye shall give forty and two cities."
4,35,7,"All the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities; them `shall ye give' with their suburbs."
4,35,8,"And concerning the cities which ye shall give of the possession of the children of Israel, from the many ye shall take many; and from the few ye shall take few: every one according to his inheritance which he inheriteth shall give of his cities unto the Levites."
4,35,9,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,"
4,35,10,"Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,"
4,35,11,"then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer that killeth any person unwittingly may flee thither."
4,35,12,"And the cities shall be unto you for refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation for judgment."
4,35,13,"And the cities which ye shall give shall be for you six cities of refuge."
4,35,14,"Ye shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan; they shall be cities of refuge."
4,35,15,"For the children of Israel, and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them, shall these six cities be for refuge; that every one that killeth any person unwittingly may flee thither."
4,35,16,"But if he smote him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death."
4,35,17,"And if he smote him with a stone in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death."
4,35,18,"Or if he smote him with a weapon of wood in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death."
4,35,19,"The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death: when he meeteth him, he shall put him to death."
4,35,20,"And if he thrust him of hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait, so that he died,"
4,35,21,"or in enmity smote him with his hand, so that he died; he that smote him shall surely be put to death; he is a murderer: the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death, when he meeteth him."
4,35,22,"But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled upon him anything without lying in wait,"
4,35,23,"or with any stone, whereby a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm;"
4,35,24,"then the congregation shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances;"
4,35,25,"and the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil."
4,35,26,"But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, whither he fleeth,"
4,35,27,"and the avenger of blood find him without the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood slay the manslayer; he shall not be guilty of blood,"
4,35,28,"because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession."
4,35,29,"And these things shall be for a statute `and' ordinance unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings."
4,35,30,"Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die."
4,35,31,"Moreover ye shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer, that is guilty of death; but he shall surely be put to death."
4,35,32,"And ye shall take no ransom for him that is fled to his city of refuge, that he may come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest."
4,35,33,"So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood, it polluteth the land; and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it."
4,35,34,"And thou shalt not defile the land which ye inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell: for I, Jehovah, dwell in the midst of the children of Israel."
4,36,1,"And the heads of the fathers' `houses' of the family of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the heads of the fathers' `houses' of the children of Israel:"
4,36,2,"and they said, Jehovah commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters."
4,36,3,"And if they be married to any of the sons of the `other' tribes of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance."
4,36,4,"And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then will their inheritance be added unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers."
4,36,5,"And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of Jehovah, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaketh right."
4,36,6,"This is the thing which Jehovah doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them be married to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married."
4,36,7,"So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall cleave every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers."
4,36,8,"And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers."
4,36,9,"So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall cleave every one to his own inheritance."
4,36,10,"Even as Jehovah commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:"
4,36,11,"for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons."
4,36,12,"They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father."
4,36,13,"These are the commandments and the ordinances which Jehovah commanded by Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho."
5,1,1,"These are the words which Moses spake unto all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah over against Suph, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Di-zahab."
5,1,2,"It is eleven days' `journey' from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadesh-barnea."
5,1,3,"And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that Jehovah had given him in commandment unto them;"
5,1,4,"after he had smitten Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ashtaroth, at Edrei."
5,1,5,"Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,"
5,1,6,"Jehovah our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mountain:"
5,1,7,"turn you, and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites, and unto all `the places' nigh thereunto, in the Arabah, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and in the South, and by the sea-shore, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates."
5,1,8,"Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which Jehovah sware unto your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them."
5,1,9,"And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:"
5,1,10,"Jehovah your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude."
5,1,11,"Jehovah, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!"
5,1,12,"How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?"
5,1,13,"Take you wise men, and understanding, and known, according to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you."
5,1,14,"And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good `for us' to do."
5,1,15,"So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes."
5,1,16,"And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear `the causes' between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the sojourner that is with him."
5,1,17,"Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; ye shall hear the small and the great alike; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you ye shall bring unto me, and I will hear it."
5,1,18,"And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do."
5,1,19,"And we journeyed from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which ye saw, by the way to the hill-country of the Amorites, as Jehovah our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea."
5,1,20,"And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the hill-country of the Amorites, which Jehovah our God giveth unto us."
5,1,21,"Behold, Jehovah thy God hath set the land before thee: go up, take possession, as Jehovah, the God of thy fathers, hath spoken unto thee; fear not, neither be dismayed."
5,1,22,"And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities unto which we shall come."
5,1,23,"And the thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe:"
5,1,24,"and they turned and went up into the hill-country, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out."
5,1,25,"And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which Jehovah our God giveth unto us."
5,1,26,"Yet ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah your God:"
5,1,27,"and ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because Jehovah hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us."
5,1,28,"Whither are we going up? our brethren have made our heart to melt, saying, The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there."
5,1,29,"Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them."
5,1,30,"Jehovah your God who goeth before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,"
5,1,31,"and in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that Jehovah thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came unto this place."
5,1,32,"Yet in this thing ye did not believe Jehovah your God,"
5,1,33,"who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way ye should go, and in the cloud by day."
5,1,34,"And Jehovah heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,"
5,1,35,"Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see the good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,"
5,1,36,"save Caleb the son of Jephunneh: he shall see it; and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed Jehovah."
5,1,37,"Also Jehovah was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither:"
5,1,38,"Joshua the son of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage thou him; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it."
5,1,39,"Moreover your little ones, that ye said should be a prey, and your children, that this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it."
5,1,40,"But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea."
5,1,41,"Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against Jehovah, we will go up and fight, according to all that Jehovah our God commanded us. And ye girded on every man his weapons of war, and were forward to go up into the hill-country."
5,1,42,"And Jehovah said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies."
5,1,43,"So I spake unto you, and ye hearkened not; but ye rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill-country."
5,1,44,"And the Amorites, that dwelt in that hill-country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even unto Hormah."
5,1,45,"And ye returned and wept before Jehovah; but Jehovah hearkened not to your voice, nor gave ear unto you."
5,1,46,"So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode `there'."
5,2,1,"Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as Jehovah spake unto me; and we compassed mount Seir many days."
5,2,2,"And Jehovah spake unto me, saying,"
5,2,3,"Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward."
5,2,4,"And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore;"
5,2,5,"contend not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession."
5,2,6,"Ye shall purchase food of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink."
5,2,7,"For Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee in all the work of thy hand; he hath known thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years Jehovah thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing."
5,2,8,"So we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion-geber. And we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab."
5,2,9,"And Jehovah said unto me, Vex not Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give thee of his land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession."
5,2,10,"(The Emim dwelt therein aforetime, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim:"
5,2,11,"these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim."
5,2,12,"The Horites also dwelt in Seir aforetime, but the children of Esau succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which Jehovah gave unto them.)"
5,2,13,"Now rise up, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered."
5,2,14,"And the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, were thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the midst of the camp, as Jehovah sware unto them."
5,2,15,"Moreover the hand of Jehovah was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed."
5,2,16,"So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,"
5,2,17,"that Jehovah spake unto me, saying,"
5,2,18,"Thou art this day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab:"
5,2,19,"and when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, vex them not, nor contend with them; for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession."
5,2,20,"(That also is accounted a land of Rephaim: Rephaim dwelt therein aforetime; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,"
5,2,21,"a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; but Jehovah destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead;"
5,2,22,"as he did for the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:"
5,2,23,"and the Avvim, that dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, that came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)"
5,2,24,"Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon: behold, I have given into thy hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle."
5,2,25,"This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the peoples that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee."
5,2,26,"And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,"
5,2,27,"Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the highway, I will turn neither unto the right hand nor to the left."
5,2,28,"Thou shalt sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only let me pass through on my feet,"
5,2,29,"as the children of Esau that dwell in Seir, and the Moabites that dwell in Ar, did unto me; until I shall pass over the Jordan into the land which Jehovah our God giveth us."
5,2,30,"But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for Jehovah thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as at this day."
5,2,31,"And Jehovah said unto me, Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land."
5,2,32,"Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Jahaz."
5,2,33,"And Jehovah our God delivered him up before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people."
5,2,34,"And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones; we left none remaining:"
5,2,35,"only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken."
5,2,36,"From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and `from' the city that is in the valley, even unto Gilead, there was not a city too high for us; Jehovah our God delivered up all before us:"
5,2,37,"only to the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not near; all the side of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill-country, and wheresoever Jehovah our God forbade us."
5,3,1,"Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Edrei."
5,3,2,"And Jehovah said unto me, Fear him not; for I have delivered him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon."
5,3,3,"So Jehovah our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining."
5,3,4,"And we took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we took not from them; threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan."
5,3,5,"All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides the unwalled towns a great many."
5,3,6,"And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones."
5,3,7,"But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey unto ourselves."
5,3,8,"And we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon unto mount Hermon;"
5,3,9,"(`which' Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir;)"
5,3,10,"all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan."
5,3,11,"(For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.)"
5,3,12,"And this land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill-country of Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites:"
5,3,13,"and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim."
5,3,14,"Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth-jair, unto this day.)"
5,3,15,"And I gave Gilead unto Machir."
5,3,16,"And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and the border `thereof', even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;"
5,3,17,"the Arabah also, and the Jordan and the border `thereof', from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward."
5,3,18,"And I commanded you at that time, saying, Jehovah your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all the men of valor."
5,3,19,"But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you,"
5,3,20,"until Jehovah give rest unto your brethren, as unto you, and they also possess the land which Jehovah your God giveth them beyond the Jordan: then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you."
5,3,21,"And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that Jehovah your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall Jehovah do unto all the kingdoms whither thou goest over."
5,3,22,"Ye shall not fear them; for Jehovah your God, he it is that fighteth for you."
5,3,23,"And I besought Jehovah at that time, saying,"
5,3,24,"O Lord Jehovah, thou hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness, and thy strong hand: for what god is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy mighty acts?"
5,3,25,"Let me go over, I pray thee, and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon."
5,3,26,"But Jehovah was wroth with me for your sakes, and hearkened not unto me; and Jehovah said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter."
5,3,27,"Get thee up unto the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan."
5,3,28,"But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see."
5,3,29,"So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor."
5,4,1,"And now, O Israel, hearken unto the statutes and unto the ordinances, which I teach you, to do them; that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which Jehovah, the God of your fathers, giveth you."
5,4,2,"Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish from it, that ye may keep the commandments of Jehovah your God which I command you."
5,4,3,"Your eyes have seen what Jehovah did because of Baal-peor; for all the men that followed Baal-peor, Jehovah thy God hath destroyed them from the midst of thee."
5,4,4,"But ye that did cleave unto Jehovah your God are alive every one of you this day."
5,4,5,"Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as Jehovah my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the midst of the land whither ye go in to possess it."
5,4,6,"Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, that shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people."
5,4,7,"For what great nation is there, that hath a god so nigh unto them, as Jehovah our God is whensoever we call upon him?"
5,4,8,"And what great nation is there, that hath statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?"
5,4,9,"Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes saw, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life; but make them known unto thy children and thy children's children;"
5,4,10,"the day that thou stoodest before Jehovah thy God in Horeb, when Jehovah said unto me, Assemble me the people, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children."
5,4,11,"And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the heart of heaven, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness."
5,4,12,"And Jehovah spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of words, but ye saw no form; only `ye heard' a voice."
5,4,13,"And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone."
5,4,14,"And Jehovah commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it."
5,4,15,"Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of form on the day that Jehovah spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire."
5,4,16,"Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,"
5,4,17,"the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flieth in the heavens,"
5,4,18,"the likeness of anything that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth;"
5,4,19,"and lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the host of heaven, thou be drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which Jehovah thy God hath allotted unto all the peoples under the whole heaven."
5,4,20,"But Jehovah hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as at this day."
5,4,21,"Furthermore Jehovah was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:"
5,4,22,"but I must die in this land, I must not go over the Jordan; but ye shall go over, and possess that good land."
5,4,23,"Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of Jehovah your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image in the form of anything which Jehovah thy God hath forbidden thee."
5,4,24,"For Jehovah thy God is a devouring fire, a jealous God."
5,4,25,"When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have been long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image in the form of anything, and shall do that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah thy God, to provoke him to anger;"
5,4,26,"I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over the Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed."
5,4,27,"And Jehovah will scatter you among the peoples, and ye shall be left few in number among the nations, whither Jehovah shall lead you away."
5,4,28,"And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell."
5,4,29,"But from thence ye shall seek Jehovah thy God, and thou shalt find him, when thou searchest after him with all thy heart and with all thy soul."
5,4,30,"When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, in the latter days thou shalt return to Jehovah thy God, and hearken unto his voice:"
5,4,31,"for Jehovah thy God is a merciful God; he will not fail thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them."
5,4,32,"For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and from the one end of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been `any such thing' as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?"
5,4,33,"Did ever a people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?"
5,4,34,"Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of `another' nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that Jehovah your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?"
5,4,35,"Unto thee it was showed, that thou mightest know that Jehovah he is God; there is none else besides him."
5,4,36,"Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he made thee to see his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire."
5,4,37,"And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out with his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt;"
5,4,38,"to drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as at this day."
5,4,39,"Know therefore this day, and lay it to thy heart, that Jehovah he is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath; there is none else."
5,4,40,"And thou shalt keep his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days in the land, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, for ever."
5,4,41,"Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising;"
5,4,42,"that the manslayer might flee thither, that slayeth his neighbor unawares, and hated him not in time past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:"
5,4,43,"`namely', Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites."
5,4,44,"And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:"
5,4,45,"these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, when they came forth out of Egypt,"
5,4,46,"beyond the Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, when they came forth out of Egypt."
5,4,47,"And they took his land in possession, and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising;"
5,4,48,"from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, even unto mount Sion (the same is Hermon),"
5,4,49,"and all the Arabah beyond the Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah."
5,5,1,"And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the ordinances which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and observe to do them."
5,5,2,"Jehovah our God made a covenant with us in Horeb."
5,5,3,"Jehovah made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day."
5,5,4,"Jehovah spake with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire,"
5,5,5,"(I stood between Jehovah and you at that time, to show you the word of Jehovah: for ye were afraid because of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,"
5,5,6,"I am Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage."
5,5,7,"Thou shalt have no other gods before me."
5,5,8,"Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, `nor' any likeness `of anything' that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:"
5,5,9,"thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them; for I, Jehovah, thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate me;"
5,5,10,"and showing lovingkindness unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments."
5,5,11,"Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain: for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain."
5,5,12,"Observe the sabbath day, to keep it holy, as Jehovah thy God commanded thee."
5,5,13,"Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work;"
5,5,14,"but the seventh day is a sabbath unto Jehovah thy God: `in it' thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy man-servant and thy maid-servant may rest as well as thou."
5,5,15,"And thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah thy God brought thee out thence by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm: therefore Jehovah thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day."
5,5,16,"Honor thy father and thy mother, as Jehovah thy God commanded thee; that thy days may be long, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee."
5,5,17,"Thou shalt not kill."
5,5,18,"Neither shalt thou commit adultery."
5,5,19,"Neither shalt thou steal."
5,5,20,"Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbor."
5,5,21,"Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor's wife; neither shalt thou desire thy neighbor's house, his field, or his man-servant, or his maid-servant, his ox, or his ass, or anything that is thy neighbor's."
5,5,22,"These words Jehovah spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them upon two tables of stone, and gave them unto me."
5,5,23,"And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, that ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;"
5,5,24,"and ye said, Behold, Jehovah our God hath showed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth speak with man, and he liveth."
5,5,25,"Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of Jehovah our God any more, then we shall die."
5,5,26,"For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?"
5,5,27,"Go thou near, and hear all that Jehovah our God shall say: and speak thou unto us all that Jehovah our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it."
5,5,28,"And Jehovah heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and Jehovah said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken."
5,5,29,"Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!"
5,5,30,"Go say to them, Return ye to your tents."
5,5,31,"But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it."
5,5,32,"Ye shall observe to do therefore as Jehovah your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left."
5,5,33,"Ye shall walk in all the way which Jehovah your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess."
5,6,1,"Now this is the commandment, the statutes, and the ordinances, which Jehovah your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it;"
5,6,2,"that thou mightest fear Jehovah thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged."
5,6,3,"Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as Jehovah, the God of thy fathers, hath promised unto thee, in a land flowing with milk and honey."
5,6,4,"Hear, O Israel: Jehovah our God is one Jehovah:"
5,6,5,"and thou shalt love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might."
5,6,6,"And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart;"
5,6,7,"and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up."
5,6,8,"And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes."
5,6,9,"And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates."
5,6,10,"And it shall be, when Jehovah thy God shall bring thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee, great and goodly cities, which thou buildest not,"
5,6,11,"and houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and cisterns hewn out, which thou hewedst not, vineyards and olive-trees, which thou plantedst not, and thou shalt eat and be full;"
5,6,12,"then beware lest thou forget Jehovah, who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage."
5,6,13,"Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God; and him shalt thou serve, and shalt swear by his name."
5,6,14,"Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples that are round about you;"
5,6,15,"for Jehovah thy God in the midst of thee is a jealous God; lest the anger of Jehovah thy God be kindled against thee, and he destroy thee from off the face of the earth."
5,6,16,"Ye shall not tempt Jehovah your God, as ye tempted him in Massah."
5,6,17,"Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of Jehovah your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee."
5,6,18,"And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of Jehovah; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which Jehovah sware unto thy fathers,"
5,6,19,"to thrust out all thine enemies from before thee, as Jehovah hath spoken."
5,6,20,"When thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Jehovah our God hath commanded you?"
5,6,21,"then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt: and Jehovah brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand;"
5,6,22,"and Jehovah showed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his house, before our eyes;"
5,6,23,"and he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers."
5,6,24,"And Jehovah commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Jehovah our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as at this day."
5,6,25,"And it shall be righteousness unto us, if we observe to do all this commandment before Jehovah our God, as he hath commanded us."
5,7,1,"When Jehovah thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and shall cast out many nations before thee, the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;"
5,7,2,"and when Jehovah thy God shall deliver them up before thee, and thou shalt smite them; then thou shalt utterly destroy them: thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them;"
5,7,3,"neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son."
5,7,4,"For he will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of Jehovah be kindled against you, and he will destroy thee quickly."
5,7,5,"But thus shall ye deal with them: ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and hew down their Asherim, and burn their graven images with fire."
5,7,6,"For thou art a holy people unto Jehovah thy God: Jehovah thy God hath chosen thee to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples that are upon the face of the earth."
5,7,7,"Jehovah did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all peoples:"
5,7,8,"but because Jehovah loveth you, and because he would keep the oath which he sware unto your fathers, hath Jehovah brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt."
5,7,9,"Know therefore that Jehovah thy God, he is God, the faithful God, who keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations,"
5,7,10,"and repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face."
5,7,11,"Thou shalt therefore keep the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which I command thee this day, to do them."
5,7,12,"And it shall come to pass, because ye hearken to these ordinances, and keep and do them, that Jehovah thy God will keep with thee the covenant and the lovingkindness which he sware unto thy fathers:"
5,7,13,"and he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee; he will also bless the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground, thy grain and thy new wine and thine oil, the increase of thy cattle and the young of thy flock, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee."
5,7,14,"Thou shalt be blessed above all peoples: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle."
5,7,15,"And Jehovah will take away from thee all sickness; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, will he put upon thee, but will lay them upon all them that hate thee."
5,7,16,"And thou shalt consume all the peoples that Jehovah thy God shall deliver unto thee; thine eye shall not pity them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee."
5,7,17,"If thou shalt say in thy heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?"
5,7,18,"thou shalt not be afraid of them: thou shalt well remember what Jehovah thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;"
5,7,19,"the great trials which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, whereby Jehovah thy God brought thee out: so shall Jehovah thy God do unto all the peoples of whom thou art afraid."
5,7,20,"Moreover Jehovah thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves, perish from before thee."
5,7,21,"Thou shalt not be affrighted at them; for Jehovah thy God is in the midst of thee, a great God and a terrible."
5,7,22,"And Jehovah thy God will cast out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee."
5,7,23,"But Jehovah thy God will deliver them up before thee, and will discomfit them with a great discomfiture, until they be destroyed."
5,7,24,"And he will deliver their kings into thy hand, and thou shalt make their name to perish from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them."
5,7,25,"The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein; for it is an abomination to Jehovah thy God."
5,7,26,"And thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy house, and become a devoted thing like unto it: thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing."
5,8,1,"All the commandment which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which Jehovah sware unto your fathers."
5,8,2,"And thou shalt remember all the way which Jehovah thy God hath led thee these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble thee, to prove thee, to know what was in thy heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or not."
5,8,3,"And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by everything that proceedeth out of the mouth of Jehovah doth man live."
5,8,4,"Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years."
5,8,5,"And thou shalt consider in thy heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so Jehovah thy God chasteneth thee."
5,8,6,"And thou shalt keep the commandments of Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him."
5,8,7,"For Jehovah thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, flowing forth in valleys and hills;"
5,8,8,"a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig-trees and pomegranates; a land of olive-trees and honey;"
5,8,9,"a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig copper."
5,8,10,"And thou shalt eat and be full, and thou shalt bless Jehovah thy God for the good land which he hath given thee."
5,8,11,"Beware lest thou forget Jehovah thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his ordinances, and his statutes, which I command thee this day:"
5,8,12,"lest, when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein;"
5,8,13,"and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;"
5,8,14,"then thy heart be lifted up, and thou forget Jehovah thy God, who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage;"
5,8,15,"who led thee through the great and terrible wilderness, `wherein were' fiery serpents and scorpions, and thirsty ground where was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;"
5,8,16,"who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not; that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end:"
5,8,17,"and `lest' thou say in thy heart, My power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth."
5,8,18,"But thou shalt remember Jehovah thy God, for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth; that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as at this day."
5,8,19,"And it shall be, if thou shalt forget Jehovah thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish."
5,8,20,"As the nations that Jehovah maketh to perish before you, so shall ye perish; because ye would not hearken unto the voice of Jehovah your God."
5,9,1,"Hear, O Israel: thou art to pass over the Jordan this day, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fortified up to heaven,"
5,9,2,"a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the sons of Anak?"
5,9,3,"Know therefore this day, that Jehovah thy God is he who goeth over before thee as a devouring fire; he will destroy them, and he will bring them down before thee: so shalt thou drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as Jehovah hath spoken unto thee."
5,9,4,"Speak not thou in thy heart, after that Jehovah thy God hath thrust them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness Jehovah hath brought me in to possess this land; whereas for the wickedness of these nations Jehovah doth drive them out from before thee."
5,9,5,"Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thy heart, dost thou go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations Jehovah thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may establish the word which Jehovah sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."
5,9,6,"Know therefore, that Jehovah thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people."
5,9,7,"Remember, forget thou not, how thou provokedst Jehovah thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou wentest forth out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against Jehovah."
5,9,8,"Also in Horeb ye provoked Jehovah to wrath, and Jehovah was angry with you to destroy you."
5,9,9,"When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which Jehovah made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water."
5,9,10,"And Jehovah delivered unto me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them `was written' according to all the words, which Jehovah speak with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly."
5,9,11,"And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that Jehovah gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant."
5,9,12,"And Jehovah said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people that thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image."
5,9,13,"Furthermore Jehovah spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:"
5,9,14,"let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they."
5,9,15,"So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount was burning with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands."
5,9,16,"And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against Jehovah your God; ye had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which Jehovah had commanded you."
5,9,17,"And I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes."
5,9,18,"And I fell down before Jehovah, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water; because of all your sin which ye sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger."
5,9,19,"For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith Jehovah was wroth against you to destroy you. But Jehovah hearkened unto me that time also."
5,9,20,"And Jehovah was very angry with Aaron to destroy him: and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time."
5,9,21,"And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount."
5,9,22,"And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked Jehovah to wrath."
5,9,23,"And when Jehovah sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice."
5,9,24,"Ye have been rebellious against Jehovah from the day that I knew you."
5,9,25,"So I fell down before Jehovah the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because Jehovah had said he would destroy you."
5,9,26,"And I prayed unto Jehovah, and said, O Lord Jehovah, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, that thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, that thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand."
5,9,27,"Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin,"
5,9,28,"lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because Jehovah was not able to bring them into the land which he promised unto them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness."
5,9,29,"Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy great power and by thine outstretched arm."
5,10,1,"At that time Jehovah said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood."
5,10,2,"And I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark."
5,10,3,"So I made an ark of acacia wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in my hand."
5,10,4,"And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which Jehovah spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and Jehovah gave them unto me."
5,10,5,"And I turned and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are as Jehovah commanded me."
5,10,6,"(And the children of Israel journeyed from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead."
5,10,7,"From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water."
5,10,8,"At that time Jehovah set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, to stand before Jehovah to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day."
5,10,9,"Wherefore Levi hath no portion nor inheritance with his brethren; Jehovah is his inheritance, according as Jehovah thy God spake unto him.)"
5,10,10,"And I stayed in the mount, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights: and Jehovah hearkened unto me that time also; Jehovah would not destroy thee."
5,10,11,"And Jehovah said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the people; and they shall go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them."
5,10,12,"And now, Israel, what doth Jehovah thy God require of thee, but to fear Jehovah thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,"
5,10,13,"to keep the commandments of Jehovah, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?"
5,10,14,"Behold, unto Jehovah thy God belongeth heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth, with all that is therein."
5,10,15,"Only Jehovah had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all peoples, as at this day."
5,10,16,"Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked."
5,10,17,"For Jehovah your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the terrible, who regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward."
5,10,18,"He doth execute justice for the fatherless and widow, and loveth the sojourner, in giving him food and raiment."
5,10,19,"Love ye therefore the sojourner; for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt."
5,10,20,"Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God; him shalt thou serve; and to him shalt thou cleave, and by his name shalt thou swear."
5,10,21,"He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen."
5,10,22,"Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now Jehovah thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude."
5,11,1,"Therefore thou shalt love Jehovah thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his ordinances, and his commandments, alway."
5,11,2,"And know ye this day: for `I speak' not with your children that have not known, and that have not seen the chastisement of Jehovah your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his outstretched arm,"
5,11,3,"and his signs, and his works, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;"
5,11,4,"and what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how Jehovah hath destroyed them unto this day;"
5,11,5,"and what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came unto this place;"
5,11,6,"and what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel:"
5,11,7,"but your eyes have seen all the great work of Jehovah which he did."
5,11,8,"Therefore shall ye keep all the commandment which I command thee this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go over to possess it;"
5,11,9,"and that ye may prolong your days in the land, which Jehovah sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey."
5,11,10,"For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs;"
5,11,11,"but the land, whither ye go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, `and' drinketh water of the rain of heaven,"
5,11,12,"a land which Jehovah thy God careth for: the eyes of Jehovah thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year."
5,11,13,"And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love Jehovah your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,"
5,11,14,"that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy grain, and thy new wine, and thine oil."
5,11,15,"And I will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle, and thou shalt eat and be full."
5,11,16,"Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;"
5,11,17,"and the anger of Jehovah be kindled against you, and he shut up the heavens, so that there shall be no rain, and the land shall not yield its fruit; and ye perish quickly from off the good land which Jehovah giveth you."
5,11,18,"Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul; and ye shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes."
5,11,19,"And ye shall teach them your children, talking of them, when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up."
5,11,20,"And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates;"
5,11,21,"that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which Jehovah sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth."
5,11,22,"For if ye shall diligently keep all this commandment which I command you, to do it, to love Jehovah your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;"
5,11,23,"then will Jehovah drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves."
5,11,24,"Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the hinder sea shall be your border."
5,11,25,"There shall no man be able to stand before you: Jehovah your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath spoken unto you."
5,11,26,"Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse:"
5,11,27,"the blessing, if ye shall hearken unto the commandments of Jehovah your God, which I command you this day;"
5,11,28,"and the curse, if ye shall not hearken unto the commandments of Jehovah your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known."
5,11,29,"And it shall come to pass, when Jehovah thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt set the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal."
5,11,30,"Are they not beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites that dwell in the Arabah, over against Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?"
5,11,31,"For ye are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein."
5,11,32,"And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set before you this day."
5,12,1,"These are the statutes and the ordinances which ye shall observe to do in the land which Jehovah, the God of thy fathers, hath given thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth."
5,12,2,"Ye shall surely destroy all the places wherein the nations that ye shall dispossess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:"
5,12,3,"and ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and burn their Asherim with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods; and ye shall destroy their name out of that place."
5,12,4,"Ye shall not do so unto Jehovah your God."
5,12,5,"But unto the place which Jehovah your God shall choose out of all your tribes, to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come;"
5,12,6,"and thither ye shall bring your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill-offerings, and the firstlings of your herd and of your flock:"
5,12,7,"and there ye shall eat before Jehovah your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee."
5,12,8,"Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes;"
5,12,9,"for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee."
5,12,10,"But when ye go over the Jordan, and dwell in the land which Jehovah your God causeth you to inherit, and he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety;"
5,12,11,"then it shall come to pass that to the place which Jehovah your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, thither shall ye bring all that I command you: your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto Jehovah."
5,12,12,"And ye shall rejoice before Jehovah your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and the Levite that is within your gates, forasmuch as he hath no portion nor inheritance with you."
5,12,13,"Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in every place that thou seest;"
5,12,14,"but in the place which Jehovah shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee."
5,12,15,"Notwithstanding, thou mayest kill and eat flesh within all thy gates, after all the desire of thy soul, according to the blessing of Jehovah thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the gazelle, and as of the hart."
5,12,16,"Only ye shall not eat the blood; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water."
5,12,17,"Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy grain, or of thy new wine, or of thine oil, or the firstlings of thy herd or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill-offerings, nor the heave-offering of thy hand;"
5,12,18,"but thou shalt eat them before Jehovah thy God in the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before Jehovah thy God in all that thou puttest thy hand unto."
5,12,19,"Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest in thy land."
5,12,20,"When Jehovah thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul desireth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, after all the desire of thy soul."
5,12,21,"If the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose, to put his name there, be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which Jehovah hath given thee, as I have commanded thee; and thou mayest eat within thy gates, after all the desire of thy soul."
5,12,22,"Even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat thereof: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof alike."
5,12,23,"Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou shalt not eat the life with the flesh."
5,12,24,"Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water."
5,12,25,"Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah."
5,12,26,"Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which Jehovah shall choose:"
5,12,27,"and thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of Jehovah thy God; and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of Jehovah thy God; and thou shalt eat the flesh."
5,12,28,"Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the eyes of Jehovah thy God."
5,12,29,"When Jehovah thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest in to dispossess them, and thou dispossessest them, and dwellest in their land;"
5,12,30,"take heed to thyself that thou be not ensnared to follow them, after that they are destroyed from before thee; and that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How do these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise."
5,12,31,"Thou shalt not do so unto Jehovah thy God: for every abomination to Jehovah, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods."
5,12,32,"What thing soever I command you, that shall ye observe to do: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it."
5,13,1,"If there arise in the midst of thee a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and he give thee a sign or a wonder,"
5,13,2,"and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them;"
5,13,3,"thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or unto that dreamer of dreams: for Jehovah your God proveth you, to know whether ye love Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul."
5,13,4,"Ye shall walk after Jehovah your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him."
5,13,5,"And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death, because he hath spoken rebellion against Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage, to draw thee aside out of the way which Jehovah thy God commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee."
5,13,6,"If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, that is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;"
5,13,7,"of the gods of the peoples that are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth;"
5,13,8,"thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him:"
5,13,9,"but thou shalt surely kill him; thy hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people."
5,13,10,"And thou shalt stone him to death with stones, because he hath sought to draw thee away from Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage."
5,13,11,"And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do not more any such wickedness as this is in the midst of thee."
5,13,12,"If thou shalt hear tell concerning one of thy cities, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to dwell there, saying,"
5,13,13,"Certain base fellows are gone out from the midst of thee, and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known;"
5,13,14,"then shalt thou inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in the midst of thee,"
5,13,15,"thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword."
5,13,16,"And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, unto Jehovah thy God: and it shall be a heap for ever; it shall not be built again."
5,13,17,"And there shall cleave nought of the devoted thing to thy hand; that Jehovah may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and show thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers;"
5,13,18,"when thou shalt hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah thy God."
5,14,1,"Ye are the children of Jehovah your God: ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead."
5,14,2,"For thou art a holy people unto Jehovah thy God, and Jehovah hath chosen thee to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples that are upon the face of the earth."
5,14,3,"Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing."
5,14,4,"These are the beasts which ye may eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,"
5,14,5,"the hart, and the gazelle, and the roebuck, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the antelope, and the chamois."
5,14,6,"And every beast that parteth the hoof, and hath the hoof cloven in two, `and' cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that may ye eat."
5,14,7,"Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that have the hoof cloven: the camel, and the hare, and the coney; because they chew the cud but part not the hoof, they are unclean unto you."
5,14,8,"And the swine, because he parteth the hoof but cheweth not the cud, he is unclean unto you: of their flesh ye shall not eat, and their carcasses ye shall not touch."
5,14,9,"These ye may eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales may ye eat;"
5,14,10,"and whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye shall not eat; it is unclean unto you."
5,14,11,"Of all clean birds ye may eat."
5,14,12,"But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the gier-eagle, and the ospray,"
5,14,13,"and the glede, and the falcon, and the kite after its kind,"
5,14,14,"and every raven after its kind,"
5,14,15,"and the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the sea-mew, and the hawk after its kind,"
5,14,16,"the little owl, and the great owl, and the horned owl,"
5,14,17,"and the pelican, and the vulture, and the cormorant,"
5,14,18,"and the stork, and the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat."
5,14,19,"And all winged creeping things are unclean unto you: they shall not be eaten."
5,14,20,"Of all clean birds ye may eat."
5,14,21,"Ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself: thou mayest give it unto the sojourner that is within thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto a foreigner: for thou art a holy people unto Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother's milk."
5,14,22,"Thou shalt surely tithe all the increase of thy seed, that which cometh forth from the field year by year."
5,14,23,"And thou shalt eat before Jehovah thy God, in the place which he shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, the tithe of thy grain, of thy new wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herd and of thy flock; that thou mayest learn to fear Jehovah thy God always."
5,14,24,"And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it, because the place is too far from thee, which Jehovah thy God shall choose, to set his name there, when Jehovah thy God shall bless thee;"
5,14,25,"then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thy hand, and shalt go unto the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose:"
5,14,26,"and thou shalt bestow the money for whatsoever thy soul desireth, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul asketh of thee; and thou shalt eat there before Jehovah thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou and thy household."
5,14,27,"And the Levite that is within thy gates, thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no portion nor inheritance with thee."
5,14,28,"At the end of every three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase in the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates:"
5,14,29,"and the Levite, because he hath no portion nor inheritance with thee, and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in all the work of thy hand which thou doest."
5,15,1,"At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release."
5,15,2,"And this is the manner of the release: every creditor shall release that which he hath lent unto his neighbor; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother; because Jehovah's release hath been proclaimed."
5,15,3,"Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it: but whatsoever of thine is with thy brother thy hand shall release."
5,15,4,"Howbeit there shall be no poor with thee; (for Jehovah will surely bless thee in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it;)"
5,15,5,"if only thou diligently hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God, to observe to do all this commandment which I command thee this day."
5,15,6,"For Jehovah thy God will bless thee, as he promised thee: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt rule over many nations, but they shall not rule over thee."
5,15,7,"If there be with thee a poor man, one of thy brethren, within any of thy gates in thy land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thy heart, nor shut thy hand from thy poor brother;"
5,15,8,"but thou shalt surely open thy hand unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need `in that' which he wanteth."
5,15,9,"Beware that there be not a base thought in thy heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou give him nought; and he cry unto Jehovah against thee, and it be sin unto thee."
5,15,10,"Thou shalt surely give him, and thy heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him; because that for this thing Jehovah thy God will bless thee in all thy work, and in all that thou puttest thy hand unto."
5,15,11,"For the poor will never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt surely open thy hand unto thy brother, to thy needy, and to thy poor, in thy land."
5,15,12,"If thy brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee."
5,15,13,"And when thou lettest him go free from thee, thou shalt not let him go empty:"
5,15,14,"thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy threshing-floor, and out of thy winepress; as Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him."
5,15,15,"And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing to-day."
5,15,16,"And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go out from thee; because he loveth thee and thy house, because he is well with thee;"
5,15,17,"then thou shalt take an awl, and thrust it through his ear unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy maid-servant thou shalt do likewise."
5,15,18,"It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou lettest him go free from thee; for to the double of the hire of a hireling hath he served thee six years: and Jehovah thy God will bless thee in all that thou doest."
5,15,19,"All the firstling males that are born of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto Jehovah thy God: thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy herd, nor shear the firstling of thy flock."
5,15,20,"Thou shalt eat it before Jehovah thy God year by year in the place which Jehovah shall choose, thou and thy household."
5,15,21,"And if it have any blemish, `as if it be' lame or blind, any ill blemish whatsoever, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto Jehovah thy God."
5,15,22,"Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean `shall eat it' alike, as the gazelle, and as the hart."
5,15,23,"Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it out upon the ground as water."
5,16,1,"Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto Jehovah thy God; for in the month of Abib Jehovah thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night."
5,16,2,"And thou shalt sacrifice the passover unto Jehovah thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which Jehovah shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there."
5,16,3,"Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life."
5,16,4,"And there shall be no leaven seen with thee in all thy borders seven days; neither shall any of the flesh, which thou sacrificest the first day at even, remain all night until the morning."
5,16,5,"Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee;"
5,16,6,"but at the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt."
5,16,7,"And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents."
5,16,8,"Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread; and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to Jehovah thy God; thou shalt do no work `therein'."
5,16,9,"Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: from the time thou beginnest to put the sickle to the standing grain shalt thou begin to number seven weeks."
5,16,10,"And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto Jehovah thy God with a tribute of a freewill-offering of thy hand, which thou shalt give, according as Jehovah thy God blesseth thee:"
5,16,11,"and thou shalt rejoice before Jehovah thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are in the midst of thee, in the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there."
5,16,12,"And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and thou shalt observe and do these statutes."
5,16,13,"Thou shalt keep the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered in from thy threshing-floor and from thy winepress:"
5,16,14,"and thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite, and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates."
5,16,15,"Seven days shalt thou keep a feast unto Jehovah thy God in the place which Jehovah shall choose; because Jehovah thy God will bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the work of thy hands, and thou shalt be altogether joyful."
5,16,16,"Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before Jehovah thy God in the place which he shall choose: in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles; and they shall not appear before Jehovah empty:"
5,16,17,"every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of Jehovah thy God which he hath given thee."
5,16,18,"Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, according to thy tribes; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment."
5,16,19,"Thou shalt not wrest justice: thou shalt not respect persons; neither shalt thou take a bribe; for a bribe doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous."
5,16,20,"That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live, and inherit the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee."
5,16,21,"Thou shalt not plant thee an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of Jehovah thy God, which thou shalt make thee."
5,16,22,"Neither shalt thou set thee up a pillar; which Jehovah thy God hateth."
5,17,1,"Thou shalt not sacrifice unto Jehovah thy God an ox, or a sheep, wherein is a blemish, `or' anything evil; for that is an abomination unto Jehovah thy God."
5,17,2,"If there be found in the midst of thee, within any of thy gates which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that doeth that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah thy God, in transgressing his covenant,"
5,17,3,"and hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, or the sun, or the moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded;"
5,17,4,"and it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, then shalt thou inquire diligently; and, behold, if it be true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in Israel,"
5,17,5,"then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, who hath done this evil thing, unto thy gates, even the man or the woman; and thou shalt stone them to death with stones."
5,17,6,"At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is to die be put to death; at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death."
5,17,7,"The hand of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. So thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of thee."
5,17,8,"If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within thy gates; then shalt thou arise, and get thee up unto the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose;"
5,17,9,"and thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days: and thou shalt inquire; and they shall show thee the sentence of judgment."
5,17,10,"And thou shalt do according to the tenor of the sentence which they shall show thee from that place which Jehovah shall choose; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they shall teach thee:"
5,17,11,"according to the tenor of the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do; thou shalt not turn aside from the sentence which they shall show thee, to the right hand, nor to the left."
5,17,12,"And the man that doeth presumptuously, in not hearkening unto the priest that standeth to minister there before Jehovah thy God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel."
5,17,13,"And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously."
5,17,14,"When thou art come unto the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are round about me;"
5,17,15,"thou shalt surely set him king over thee, whom Jehovah thy God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee; thou mayest not put a foreigner over thee, who is not thy brother."
5,17,16,"Only he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he may multiply horses; forasmuch as Jehovah hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way."
5,17,17,"Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold."
5,17,18,"And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book, out of `that which is' before the priests the Levites:"
5,17,19,"and it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life; that he may learn to fear Jehovah his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them;"
5,17,20,"that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his children, in the midst of Israel."
5,18,1,"The priests the Levites, `even' all the tribe of Levi, shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, and his inheritance."
5,18,2,"And they shall have no inheritance among their brethren: Jehovah is their inheritance, as he hath spoken unto them."
5,18,3,"And this shall be the priests' due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw."
5,18,4,"The first-fruits of thy grain, of thy new wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him."
5,18,5,"For Jehovah thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand to minister in the name of Jehovah, him and his sons for ever."
5,18,6,"And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourneth, and come with all the desire of his soul unto the place which Jehovah shall choose;"
5,18,7,"then he shall minister in the name of Jehovah his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, who stand there before Jehovah."
5,18,8,"They shall have like portions to eat, besides that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony."
5,18,9,"When thou art come into the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations."
5,18,10,"There shall not be found with thee any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, one that useth divination, one that practiseth augury, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer,"
5,18,11,"or a charmer, or a consulter with a familiar spirit, or a wizard, or a necromancer."
5,18,12,"For whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto Jehovah: and because of these abominations Jehovah thy God doth drive them out from before thee."
5,18,13,"Thou shalt be perfect with Jehovah thy God."
5,18,14,"For these nations, that thou shalt dispossess, hearken unto them that practise augury, and unto diviners; but as for thee, Jehovah thy God hath not suffered thee so to do."
5,18,15,"Jehovah thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken;"
5,18,16,"according to all that thou desiredst of Jehovah thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of Jehovah my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not."
5,18,17,"And Jehovah said unto me, They have well said that which they have spoken."
5,18,18,"I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him."
5,18,19,"And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him."
5,18,20,"But the prophet, that shall speak a word presumptuously in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die."
5,18,21,"And if thou say in thy heart, How shall we know the word which Jehovah hath not spoken?"
5,18,22,"when a prophet speaketh in the name of Jehovah, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which Jehovah hath not spoken: the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously, thou shalt not be afraid of him."
5,19,1,"When Jehovah thy God shall cut off the nations, whose land Jehovah thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their cities, and in their houses;"
5,19,2,"thou shalt set apart three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to possess it."
5,19,3,"Thou shalt prepare thee the way, and divide the borders of thy land, which Jehovah thy God causeth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every manslayer may flee thither."
5,19,4,"And this is the case of the manslayer, that shall flee thither and live: whoso killeth his neighbor unawares, and hated him not in time past;"
5,19,5,"as when a man goeth into the forest with his neighbor to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbor, so that he dieth; he shall flee unto one of these cities and live:"
5,19,6,"lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and smite him mortally; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past."
5,19,7,"Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt set apart three cities for thee."
5,19,8,"And if Jehovah thy God enlarge thy border, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers;"
5,19,9,"if thou shalt keep all this commandment to do it, which I command thee this day, to love Jehovah thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, besides these three:"
5,19,10,"that innocent blood be not shed in the midst of thy land, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee."
5,19,11,"But if any man hate his neighbor, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally so that he dieth, and he flee into one of these cities;"
5,19,12,"then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die."
5,19,13,"Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee."
5,19,14,"Thou shalt not remove thy neighbor's landmark, which they of old time have set, in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit, in the land that Jehovah thy God giveth thee to possess it."
5,19,15,"One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established."
5,19,16,"If an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to testify against him of wrong-doing,"
5,19,17,"then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before Jehovah, before the priests and the judges that shall be in those days;"
5,19,18,"and the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and have testified falsely against his brother;"
5,19,19,"then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to do unto his brother: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee."
5,19,20,"And those that remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in the midst of thee."
5,19,21,"And thine eyes shall not pity; life `shall go' for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot."
5,20,1,"When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, `and' a people more than thou, thou shalt not be afraid of them; for Jehovah thy God is with thee, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt."
5,20,2,"And it shall be, when ye draw nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people,"
5,20,3,"and shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye draw nigh this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your heart faint; fear not, nor tremble, neither be ye affrighted at them;"
5,20,4,"for Jehovah your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you."
5,20,5,"And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it."
5,20,6,"And what man is there that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not used the fruit thereof? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man use the fruit thereof."
5,20,7,"And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her."
5,20,8,"And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and faint-hearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren's heart melt as his heart."
5,20,9,"And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that they shall appoint captains of hosts at the head of the people."
5,20,10,"When thou drawest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it."
5,20,11,"And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that are found therein shall become tributary unto thee, and shall serve thee."
5,20,12,"And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it:"
5,20,13,"and when Jehovah thy God delivereth it into thy hand, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword:"
5,20,14,"but the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take for a prey unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which Jehovah thy God hath given thee."
5,20,15,"Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations."
5,20,16,"But of the cities of these peoples, that Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth;"
5,20,17,"but thou shalt utterly destroy them: the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; as Jehovah thy God hath commanded thee;"
5,20,18,"that they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so would ye sin against Jehovah your God."
5,20,19,"When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by wielding an axe against them; for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down; for is the tree of the field man, that it should be besieged of thee?"
5,20,20,"Only the trees of which thou knowest that they are not trees for food, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it fall."
5,21,1,"If one be found slain in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath smitten him;"
5,21,2,"then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain:"
5,21,3,"and it shall be, that the city which is nearest unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke;"
5,21,4,"and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer's neck there in the valley."
5,21,5,"And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them Jehovah thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of Jehovah; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be."
5,21,6,"And all the elders of that city, who are nearest unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley;"
5,21,7,"and they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it."
5,21,8,"Forgive, O Jehovah, thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and suffer not innocent blood `to remain' in the midst of thy people Israel. And the blood shall be forgiven them."
5,21,9,"So shalt thou put away the innocent blood from the midst of thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah."
5,21,10,"When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and Jehovah thy God delivereth them into thy hands, and thou carriest them away captive,"
5,21,11,"and seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife;"
5,21,12,"then thou shalt bring her home to thy house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails;"
5,21,13,"and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thy house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife."
5,21,14,"And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not deal with her as a slave, because thou hast humbled her."
5,21,15,"If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the first-born son be hers that was hated;"
5,21,16,"then it shall be, in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved the first-born before the son of the hated, who is the first-born:"
5,21,17,"but he shall acknowledge the first-born, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath; for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the first-born is his."
5,21,18,"If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, that will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and, though they chasten him, will not hearken unto them;"
5,21,19,"then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;"
5,21,20,"and they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard."
5,21,21,"And all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee; and all Israel shall hear, and fear."
5,21,22,"And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree;"
5,21,23,"his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt surely bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is accursed of God; that thou defile not thy land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance."
5,22,1,"Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely bring them again unto thy brother."
5,22,2,"And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it home to thy house, and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him."
5,22,3,"And so shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his garment; and so shalt thou do with every lost thing of thy brother's, which he hath lost, and thou hast found: thou mayest not hide thyself."
5,22,4,"Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fallen down by the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again."
5,22,5,"A woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment; for whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto Jehovah thy God."
5,22,6,"If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young:"
5,22,7,"thou shalt surely let the dam go, but the young thou mayest take unto thyself; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days."
5,22,8,"When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thy house, if any man fall from thence."
5,22,9,"Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with two kinds of seed, lest the whole fruit be forfeited, the seed which thou hast sown, and the increase of the vineyard."
5,22,10,"Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together."
5,22,11,"Thou shalt not wear a mingled stuff, wool and linen together."
5,22,12,"Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four borders of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself."
5,22,13,"If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her,"
5,22,14,"and lay shameful things to her charge, and bring up an evil name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came nigh to her, I found not in her the tokens of virginity;"
5,22,15,"then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate;"
5,22,16,"and the damsel's father shall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her;"
5,22,17,"and, lo, he hath laid shameful things `to her charge', saying, I found not in thy daughter the tokens of virginity; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the garment before the elders of the city."
5,22,18,"And the elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him;"
5,22,19,"and they shall fine him a hundred `shekels' of silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days."
5,22,20,"But if this thing be true, that the tokens of virginity were not found in the damsel;"
5,22,21,"then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones, because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the harlot in her father's house: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee."
5,22,22,"If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both of them die, the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away the evil from Israel."
5,22,23,"If there be a damsel that is a virgin betrothed unto a husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;"
5,22,24,"then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them to death with stones; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbor's wife: so thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of thee."
5,22,25,"But if the man find the damsel that is betrothed in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her; then the man only that lay with her shall die:"
5,22,26,"but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbor, and slayeth him, even so is this matter;"
5,22,27,"for he found her in the field, the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her."
5,22,28,"If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, that is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;"
5,22,29,"then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty `shekels' of silver, and she shall be his wife, because he hath humbled her; he may not put her away all his days."
5,22,30,"A man shall not take his father's wife, and shall not uncover his father's skirt."
5,23,1,"He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the assembly of Jehovah."
5,23,2,"A bastard shall not enter into the assembly of Jehovah; even to the tenth generation shall none of his enter into the assembly of Jehovah."
5,23,3,"An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of Jehovah; even to the tenth generation shall none belonging to them enter into the assembly of Jehovah for ever:"
5,23,4,"because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt, and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse thee."
5,23,5,"Nevertheless Jehovah thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but Jehovah thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because Jehovah thy God loved thee."
5,23,6,"Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever."
5,23,7,"Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother: thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian, because thou wast a sojourner in his land."
5,23,8,"The children of the third generation that are born unto them shall enter into the assembly of Jehovah."
5,23,9,"When thou goest forth in camp against thine enemies, then thou shalt keep thee from every evil thing."
5,23,10,"If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of that which chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp:"
5,23,11,"but it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall bathe himself in water; and when the sun is down, he shall come within the camp."
5,23,12,"Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad:"
5,23,13,"and thou shalt have a paddle among thy weapons; and it shall be, when thou sittest down abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee:"
5,23,14,"for Jehovah thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy, that he may not see an unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee."
5,23,15,"Thou shalt not deliver unto his master a servant that is escaped from his master unto thee:"
5,23,16,"he shall dwell with thee, in the midst of thee, in the place which he shall choose within one of thy gates, where it pleaseth him best: thou shalt not oppress him."
5,23,17,"There shall be no prostitute of the daughters of Israel, neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of Israel."
5,23,18,"Thou shalt not bring the hire of a harlot, or the wages of a dog, into the house of Jehovah thy God for any vow: for even both these are an abomination unto Jehovah thy God."
5,23,19,"Thou shalt not lend upon interest to thy brother; interest of money, interest of victuals, interest of anything that is lent upon interest:"
5,23,20,"unto a foreigner thou mayest lend upon interest; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon interest, that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in all that thou puttest thy hand unto, in the land whither thou goest in to possess it."
5,23,21,"When thou shalt vow a vow unto Jehovah thy God, thou shalt not be slack to pay it: for Jehovah thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee."
5,23,22,"But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee."
5,23,23,"That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt observe and do; according as thou hast vowed unto Jehovah thy God, a freewill-offering, which thou hast promised with thy mouth."
5,23,24,"When thou comest into thy neighbor's vineyard, then thou mayest eat of grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel."
5,23,25,"When thou comest into thy neighbor's standing grain, then thou mayest pluck the ears with thy hand; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbor's standing grain."
5,24,1,"When a man taketh a wife, and marrieth her, then it shall be, if she find no favor in his eyes, because he hath found some unseemly thing in her, that he shall write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house."
5,24,2,"And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's `wife'."
5,24,3,"And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, who took her to be his wife;"
5,24,4,"her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before Jehovah: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance."
5,24,5,"When a man taketh a new wife, he shall not go out in the host, neither shall he be charged with any business: he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer his wife whom he hath taken."
5,24,6,"No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge; for he taketh `a man's' life to pledge."
5,24,7,"If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and he deal with him as a slave, or sell him; then that thief shall die: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee."
5,24,8,"Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do."
5,24,9,"Remember what Jehovah thy God did unto Miriam, by the way as ye came forth out of Egypt."
5,24,10,"When thou dost lend thy neighbor any manner of loan, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge."
5,24,11,"Thou shalt stand without, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring forth the pledge without unto thee."
5,24,12,"And if he be a poor man, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge;"
5,24,13,"thou shalt surely restore to him the pledge when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his garment, and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before Jehovah thy God."
5,24,14,"Thou shalt not oppress a hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy sojourners that are in thy land within thy gates:"
5,24,15,"in his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto Jehovah, and it be sin unto thee."
5,24,16,"The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin."
5,24,17,"Thou shalt not wrest the justice `due' to the sojourner, `or' to the fatherless, nor take the widow's raiment to pledge;"
5,24,18,"but thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and Jehovah thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing."
5,24,19,"When thou reapest thy harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow; that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in all the work of thy hands."
5,24,20,"When thou beatest thine olive-tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow."
5,24,21,"When thou gatherest `the grapes of' thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it after thee: it shall be for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow."
5,24,22,"And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing."
5,25,1,"If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment, and `the judges' judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked;"
5,25,2,"and it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his wickedness, by number."
5,25,3,"Forty stripes he may give him, he shall not exceed; lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brother should seem vile unto thee."
5,25,4,"Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out `the grain'."
5,25,5,"If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no son, the wife of the dead shall not be married without unto a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother unto her."
5,25,6,"And it shall be, that the first-born that she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother that is dead, that his name be not blotted out of Israel."
5,25,7,"And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then his brother's wife shall go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel; he will not perform the duty of a husband's brother unto me."
5,25,8,"Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and if he stand, and say, I like not to take her;"
5,25,9,"then shall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face; and she shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto the man that doth not build up his brother's house."
5,25,10,"And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that hath his shoe loosed."
5,25,11,"When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets;"
5,25,12,"then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall have no pity."
5,25,13,"Thou shalt not have in thy bag diverse weights, a great and a small."
5,25,14,"Thou shalt not have in thy house diverse measures, a great and a small."
5,25,15,"A perfect and just weight shalt thou have; a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be long in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee."
5,25,16,"For all that do such things, `even' all that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto Jehovah thy God."
5,25,17,"Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way as ye came forth out of Egypt;"
5,25,18,"how he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; and he feared not God."
5,25,19,"Therefore it shall be, when Jehovah thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget."
5,26,1,"And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest it, and dwellest therein,"
5,26,2,"that thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which thou shalt bring in from thy land that Jehovah thy God giveth thee; and thou shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go unto the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there."
5,26,3,"And thou shalt come unto the priest that shall be in those days, and say unto him, I profess this day unto Jehovah thy God, that I am come unto the land which Jehovah sware unto our fathers to give us."
5,26,4,"And the priest shall take the basket out of thy hand, and set it down before the altar of Jehovah thy God."
5,26,5,"And thou shalt answer and say before Jehovah thy God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father; and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there, few in number; and he became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous."
5,26,6,"And the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage:"
5,26,7,"and we cried unto Jehovah, the God of our fathers, and Jehovah heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and our toil, and our oppression;"
5,26,8,"and Jehovah brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders;"
5,26,9,"and he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey."
5,26,10,"And now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground, which thou, O Jehovah, hast given me. And thou shalt set it down before Jehovah thy God, and worship before Jehovah thy God:"
5,26,11,"and thou shalt rejoice in all the good which Jehovah thy God hath given unto thee, and unto thy house, thou, and the Levite, and the sojourner that is in the midst of thee."
5,26,12,"When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithe of thine increase in the third year, which is the year of tithing, then thou shalt give it unto the Levite, to the sojourner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled."
5,26,13,"And thou shalt say before Jehovah thy God, I have put away the hallowed things out of my house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the sojourner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy commandment which thou hast commanded me: I have not transgressed any of thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them:"
5,26,14,"I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I put away thereof, being unclean, nor given thereof for the dead: I have hearkened to the voice of Jehovah my God; I have done according to all that thou hast commanded me."
5,26,15,"Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the ground which thou hast given us, as thou swarest unto our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey."
5,26,16,"This day Jehovah thy God commandeth thee to do these statutes and ordinances: thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thy heart, and with all thy soul."
5,26,17,"Thou hast avouched Jehovah this day to be thy God, and that thou wouldest walk in his ways, and keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his ordinances, and hearken unto his voice:"
5,26,18,"and Jehovah hath avouched thee this day to be a people for his own possession, as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments;"
5,26,19,"and to make thee high above all nations that he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honor; and that thou mayest be a holy people unto Jehovah thy God, as he hath spoken."
5,27,1,"And Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandment which I command you this day."
5,27,2,"And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over the Jordan unto the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set thee up great stones, and plaster them with plaster:"
5,27,3,"and thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when thou art passed over; that thou mayest go in unto the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, as Jehovah, the God of thy fathers, hath promised thee."
5,27,4,"And it shall be, when ye are passed over the Jordan, that ye shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaster them with plaster."
5,27,5,"And there shalt thou build an altar unto Jehovah thy God, an altar of stones: thou shalt lift up no iron `tool' upon them."
5,27,6,"Thou shalt build the altar of Jehovah thy God of unhewn stones; and thou shalt offer burnt-offerings thereon unto Jehovah thy God:"
5,27,7,"and thou shalt sacrifice peace-offerings, and shalt eat there; and thou shalt rejoice before Jehovah thy God."
5,27,8,"And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly."
5,27,9,"And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel, saying, Keep silence, and hearken, O Israel: this day thou art become the people of Jehovah thy God."
5,27,10,"Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of Jehovah thy God, and do his commandments and his statutes, which I command thee this day."
5,27,11,"And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,"
5,27,12,"These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when ye are passed over the Jordan: Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin."
5,27,13,"And these shall stand upon mount Ebal for the curse: Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali."
5,27,14,"And the Levites shall answer, and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice,"
5,27,15,"Cursed be the man that maketh a graven or molten image, an abomination unto Jehovah, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and setteth it up in secret. And all the people shall answer and say, Amen."
5,27,16,"Cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen."
5,27,17,"Cursed be he that removeth his neighbor's landmark. And all the people shall say, Amen."
5,27,18,"Cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way. And all the people shall say, Amen."
5,27,19,"Cursed be he that wresteth the justice `due' to the sojourner, fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen."
5,27,20,"Cursed be he that lieth with his father's wife, because he hath uncovered his father's skirt. And all the people shall say, Amen."
5,27,21,"Cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast. And all the people shall say, Amen."
5,27,22,"Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen."
5,27,23,"Cursed be he that lieth with his mother-in-law. And all the people shall say, Amen."
5,27,24,"Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbor in secret. And all the people shall say, Amen."
5,27,25,"Cursed be he that taketh a bribe to slay an innocent person. And all the people shall say, Amen."
5,27,26,"Cursed be he that confirmeth not the words of this law to do them. And all the people shall say, Amen."
5,28,1,"And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of Jehovah thy God, to observe to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that Jehovah thy God will set thee on high above all the nations of the earth:"
5,28,2,"and all these blessings shall come upon thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God."
5,28,3,"Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field."
5,28,4,"Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy beasts, the increase of thy cattle, and the young of thy flock."
5,28,5,"Blessed shall be thy basket and thy kneading-trough."
5,28,6,"Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out."
5,28,7,"Jehovah will cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thee: they shall come out against thee one way, and shall flee before thee seven ways."
5,28,8,"Jehovah will command the blessing upon thee in thy barns, and in all that thou puttest thy hand unto; and he will bless thee in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee."
5,28,9,"Jehovah will establish thee for a holy people unto himself, as he hath sworn unto thee; if thou shalt keep the commandments of Jehovah thy God, and walk in his ways."
5,28,10,"And all the peoples of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of Jehovah; and they shall be afraid of thee."
5,28,11,"And Jehovah will make thee plenteous for good, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, in the land which Jehovah sware unto thy fathers to give thee."
5,28,12,"Jehovah will open unto thee his good treasure the heavens, to give the rain of thy land in its season, and to bless all the work of thy hand: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, and thou shalt not borrow."
5,28,13,"And Jehovah will make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if thou shalt hearken unto the commandments of Jehovah thy God, which I command thee this day, to observe and to do `them',"
5,28,14,"and shalt not turn aside from any of the words which I command you this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them."
5,28,15,"But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day, that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee."
5,28,16,"Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field."
5,28,17,"Cursed shall be thy basket and thy kneading-trough."
5,28,18,"Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, the increase of thy cattle, and the young of thy flock."
5,28,19,"Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out."
5,28,20,"Jehovah will send upon thee cursing, discomfiture, and rebuke, in all that thou puttest thy hand unto to do, until thou be destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because of the evil of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me."
5,28,21,"Jehovah will make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he have consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest in to possess it."
5,28,22,"Jehovah will smite thee with consumption, and with fever, and with inflammation, and with fiery heat, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue thee until thou perish."
5,28,23,"And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth that is under thee shall be iron."
5,28,24,"Jehovah will make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed."
5,28,25,"Jehovah will cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies; thou shalt go out one way against them, and shalt flee seven ways before them: and thou shalt be tossed to and from among all the kingdoms of the earth."
5,28,26,"And thy dead body shall be food unto all birds of the heavens, and unto the beasts of the earth; and there shall be none to frighten them away."
5,28,27,"Jehovah will smite thee with the boil of Egypt, and with the emerods, and with the scurvy, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not be healed."
5,28,28,"Jehovah will smite thee with madness, and with blindness, and with astonishment of heart;"
5,28,29,"and thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou shalt be only oppressed and robbed alway, and there shall be none to save thee."
5,28,30,"Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou shalt build a house, and thou shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not use the fruit thereof."
5,28,31,"Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof: thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face, and shall not be restored to thee: thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to save thee."
5,28,32,"Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people; and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day: and there shall be nought in the power of thy hand."
5,28,33,"The fruit of thy ground, and all thy labors, shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway;"
5,28,34,"so that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see."
5,28,35,"Jehovah will smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore boil, whereof thou canst not be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the crown of thy head."
5,28,36,"Jehovah will bring thee, and thy king whom thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation that thou hast not known, thou nor thy fathers; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone."
5,28,37,"And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all the peoples whither Jehovah shall lead thee away."
5,28,38,"Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather little in; for the locust shall consume it."
5,28,39,"Thou shalt plant vineyards and dress them, but thou shalt neither drink of the wine, nor gather `the grapes'; for the worm shall eat them."
5,28,40,"Thou shalt have olive-trees throughout all thy borders, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall cast `its fruit'."
5,28,41,"Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but they shall not be thine; for they shall go into captivity."
5,28,42,"All thy trees and the fruit of thy ground shall the locust possess."
5,28,43,"The sojourner that is in the midst of thee shall mount up above thee higher and higher; and thou shalt come down lower and lower."
5,28,44,"He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail."
5,28,45,"And all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of Jehovah thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee:"
5,28,46,"and they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever."
5,28,47,"Because thou servedst not Jehovah thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things;"
5,28,48,"therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies that Jehovah shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee."
5,28,49,"Jehovah will bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand;"
5,28,50,"a nation of fierce countenance, that shall not regard the person of the old, nor show favor to the young,"
5,28,51,"and shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy ground, until thou be destroyed; that also shall not leave thee grain, new wine, or oil, the increase of thy cattle, or the young of thy flock, until they have caused thee to perish."
5,28,52,"And they shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fortified walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land; and they shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which Jehovah thy God hath given thee."
5,28,53,"And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, whom Jehovah thy God hath given thee, in the siege and in the distress wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee."
5,28,54,"The man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children whom he hath remaining;"
5,28,55,"so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat, because he hath nothing left him, in the siege and in the distress wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in all thy gates."
5,28,56,"The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,"
5,28,57,"and toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children whom she shall bear; for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly, in the siege and in the distress wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates."
5,28,58,"If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, JEHOVAH THY GOD;"
5,28,59,"then Jehovah will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance."
5,28,60,"And he will bring upon thee again all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee."
5,28,61,"Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will Jehovah bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed."
5,28,62,"And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou didst not hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God."
5,28,63,"And it shall come to pass, that, as Jehovah rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you, so Jehovah will rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest in to possess it."
5,28,64,"And Jehovah will scatter thee among all peoples, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou nor thy fathers, even wood and stone."
5,28,65,"And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, and there shall be no rest for the sole of thy foot: but Jehovah will give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and pining of soul;"
5,28,66,"and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear night and day, and shalt have no assurance of thy life."
5,28,67,"In the morning thou shalt say, Would it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would it were morning! for the fear of thy heart which thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see."
5,28,68,"And Jehovah will bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I said unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall sell yourselves unto your enemies for bondmen and for bondwomen, and no man shall buy you."
5,29,1,"These are the words of the covenant which Jehovah commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which he made with them in Horeb."
5,29,2,"And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have seen all that Jehovah did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;"
5,29,3,"the great trials which thine eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders:"
5,29,4,"but Jehovah hath not given you a heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day."
5,29,5,"And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxed old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxed old upon thy foot."
5,29,6,"Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink; that ye may know that I am Jehovah your God."
5,29,7,"And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them:"
5,29,8,"and we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of the Manassites."
5,29,9,"Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do."
5,29,10,"Ye stand this day all of you before Jehovah your God; your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your officers, even all the men of Israel,"
5,29,11,"your little ones, your wives, and thy sojourner that is in the midst of thy camps, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water;"
5,29,12,"that thou mayest enter into the covenant of Jehovah thy God, and into his oath, which Jehovah thy God maketh with thee this day;"
5,29,13,"that he may establish thee this day unto himself for a people, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he spake unto thee, and as he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."
5,29,14,"Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath,"
5,29,15,"but with him that standeth here with us this day before Jehovah our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day;"
5,29,16,"(for ye know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the midst of the nations through which ye passed;"
5,29,17,"and ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them);"
5,29,18,"lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from Jehovah our God, to go to serve the gods of those nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood;"
5,29,19,"and it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart, to destroy the moist with the dry."
5,29,20,"Jehovah will not pardon him, but then the anger of Jehovah and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and all the curse that is written in this book shall lie upon him, and Jehovah will blot out his name from under heaven."
5,29,21,"And Jehovah will set him apart unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that is written in this book of the law."
5,29,22,"And the generation to come, your children that shall rise up after you, and the foreigner that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses wherewith Jehovah hath made it sick;"
5,29,23,"`and that' the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, `and' a burning, `that' it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which Jehovah overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:"
5,29,24,"even all the nations shall say, Wherefore hath Jehovah done thus unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger?"
5,29,25,"Then men shall say, Because they forsook the covenant of Jehovah, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt,"
5,29,26,"and went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods that they knew not, and that he had not given unto them:"
5,29,27,"therefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curse that is written in this book;"
5,29,28,"and Jehovah rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as at this day."
5,29,29,"The secret things belong unto Jehovah our God; but the things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law."
5,30,1,"And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither Jehovah thy God hath driven thee,"
5,30,2,"and shalt return unto Jehovah thy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul;"
5,30,3,"that then Jehovah thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the peoples, whither Jehovah thy God hath scattered thee."
5,30,4,"If `any of' thine outcasts be in the uttermost parts of heaven, from thence will Jehovah thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee:"
5,30,5,"and Jehovah thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers."
5,30,6,"And Jehovah thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live."
5,30,7,"And Jehovah thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, that persecuted thee."
5,30,8,"And thou shalt return and obey the voice of Jehovah, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day."
5,30,9,"And Jehovah thy God will make thee plenteous in all the work of thy hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, for good: for Jehovah will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers;"
5,30,10,"if thou shalt obey the voice of Jehovah thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law; if thou turn unto Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul."
5,30,11,"For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not too hard for thee, neither is it far off."
5,30,12,"It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?"
5,30,13,"Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?"
5,30,14,"But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it."
5,30,15,"See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;"
5,30,16,"in that I command thee this day to love Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances, that thou mayest live and multiply, and that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in the land whither thou goest in to possess it."
5,30,17,"But if thy heart turn away, and thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;"
5,30,18,"I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish; ye shall not prolong your days in the land, whither thou passest over the Jordan to go in to possess it."
5,30,19,"I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before thee life and death, the blessing and the curse: therefore choose life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed;"
5,30,20,"to love Jehovah thy God, to obey his voice, and to cleave unto him; for he is thy life, and the length of thy days; that thou mayest dwell in the land which Jehovah sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them."
5,31,1,"And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel."
5,31,2,"And he said unto them, I am a hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: and Jehovah hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan."
5,31,3,"Jehovah thy God, he will go over before thee; he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt dispossess them: `and' Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as Jehovah hath spoken."
5,31,4,"And Jehovah will do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and unto their land; whom he destroyed."
5,31,5,"And Jehovah will deliver them up before you, and ye shall do unto them according unto all the commandment which I have commanded you."
5,31,6,"Be strong and of good courage, fear not, nor be affrighted at them: for Jehovah thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee."
5,31,7,"And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of good courage: for thou shalt go with this people into the land which Jehovah hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it."
5,31,8,"And Jehovah, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed."
5,31,9,"And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and unto all the elders of Israel."
5,31,10,"And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of `every' seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,"
5,31,11,"when all Israel is come to appear before Jehovah thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing."
5,31,12,"Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and thy sojourner that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear Jehovah your God, and observe to do all the words of this law;"
5,31,13,"and that their children, who have not known, may hear, and learn to fear Jehovah your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it."
5,31,14,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tent of meeting, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tent of meeting."
5,31,15,"And Jehovah appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud: and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent."
5,31,16,"And Jehovah said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and play the harlot after the strange gods of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them."
5,31,17,"Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come upon them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?"
5,31,18,"And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods."
5,31,19,"Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach thou it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel."
5,31,20,"For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxed fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant."
5,31,21,"And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are come upon them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they frame this day, before I have brought them into the land which I sware."
5,31,22,"So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel."
5,31,23,"And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee."
5,31,24,"And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,"
5,31,25,"that Moses commanded the Levites, that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, saying,"
5,31,26,"Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee."
5,31,27,"For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against Jehovah; and how much more after my death?"
5,31,28,"Assemble unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them."
5,31,29,"For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands."
5,31,30,"And Moses spake in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished."
5,32,1,"Give ear, ye heavens, and I will speak; And let the earth hear the words of my mouth."
5,32,2,"My doctrine shall drop as the rain; My speech shall distil as the dew, As the small rain upon the tender grass, And as the showers upon the herb."
5,32,3,"For I will proclaim the name of Jehovah: Ascribe ye greatness unto our God."
5,32,4,"The Rock, his work is perfect; For all his ways are justice: A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, Just and right is he."
5,32,5,"They have dealt corruptly with him, `they are' not his children, `it is' their blemish; `They are' a perverse and crooked generation."
5,32,6,"Do ye thus requite Jehovah, O foolish people and unwise? Is not he thy father that hath bought thee? He hath made thee, and established thee."
5,32,7,"Remember the days of old, Consider the years of many generations: Ask thy father, and he will show thee; Thine elders, and they will tell thee."
5,32,8,"When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, When he separated the children of men, He set the bounds of the peoples According to the number of the children of Israel."
5,32,9,"For Jehovah's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance."
5,32,10,"He found him in a desert land, And in the waste howling wilderness; He compassed him about, he cared for him, He kept him as the apple of his eye."
5,32,11,"As an eagle that stirreth up her nest, That fluttereth over her young, He spread abroad his wings, he took them, He bare them on his pinions."
5,32,12,"Jehovah alone did lead him, And there was no foreign god with him."
5,32,13,"He made him ride on the high places of the earth, And he did eat the increase of the field; And he made him to suck honey out of the rock, And oil out of the flinty rock;"
5,32,14,"Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, With fat of lambs, And rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, With the finest of the wheat; And of the blood of the grape thou drankest wine."
5,32,15,"But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: Thou art waxed fat, thou art grown thick, thou art become sleek; Then he forsook God who made him, And lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation."
5,32,16,"They moved him to jealousy with strange `gods'; With abominations provoked they him to anger."
5,32,17,"They sacrificed unto demons, `which were' no God, To gods that they knew not, To new `gods' that came up of late, Which your fathers dreaded not."
5,32,18,"Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, And hast forgotten God that gave thee birth."
5,32,19,"And Jehovah saw `it', and abhorred `them', Because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters."
5,32,20,"And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: For they are a very perverse generation, Children in whom is no faithfulness."
5,32,21,"They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; They have provoked me to anger with their vanities: And I will move them to jealousy with those that are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation."
5,32,22,"For a fire is kindled in mine anger, And burneth unto the lowest Sheol, And devoureth the earth with its increase, And setteth on fire the foundations of the mountains."
5,32,23,"I will heap evils upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them:"
5,32,24,"`They shall be' wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat And bitter destruction; And the teeth of beasts will I send upon them, With the poison of crawling things of the dust."
5,32,25,"Without shall the sword bereave, And in the chambers terror; `It shall destroy' both young man and virgin, The suckling with the man of gray hairs."
5,32,26,"I said, I would scatter them afar, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men;"
5,32,27,"Were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy, Lest their adversaries should judge amiss, Lest they should say, Our hand is exalted, And Jehovah hath not done all this."
5,32,28,"For they are a nation void of counsel, And there is no understanding in them."
5,32,29,"Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, That they would consider their latter end!"
5,32,30,"How should one chase a thousand, And two put ten thousand to flight, Except their Rock had sold them, And Jehovah had delivered them up?"
5,32,31,"For their rock is not as our Rock, Even our enemies themselves being judges."
5,32,32,"For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, And of the fields of Gomorrah: Their grapes are grapes of gall, Their clusters are bitter:"
5,32,33,"Their wine is the poison of serpents, And the cruel venom of asps."
5,32,34,"Is not this laid up in store with me, Sealed up among my treasures?"
5,32,35,"Vengeance is mine, and recompense, At the time when their foot shall slide: For the day of their calamity is at hand, And the things that are to come upon them shall make haste."
5,32,36,"For Jehovah will judge his people, And repent himself for his servants; When he seeth that `their' power is gone, And there is none `remaining', shut up or left at large."
5,32,37,"And he will say, Where are their gods, The rock in which they took refuge;"
5,32,38,"Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, `And' drank the wine of their drink-offering? Let them rise up and help you, Let them be your protection."
5,32,39,"See now that I, even I, am he, And there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal; And there is none that can deliver out of my hand."
5,32,40,"For I lift up my hand to heaven, And say, As I live for ever,"
5,32,41,"If I whet my glittering sword, And my hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine adversaries, And will recompense them that hate me."
5,32,42,"I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, And my sword shall devour flesh; With the blood of the slain and the captives, From the head of the leaders of the enemy."
5,32,43,"Rejoice, O ye nations, `with' his people: For he will avenge the blood of his servants, And will render vengeance to his adversaries, And will make expiation for his land, for his people."
5,32,44,"And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun."
5,32,45,"And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;"
5,32,46,"And he said unto them, Set your heart unto all the words which I testify unto you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, `even' all the words of this law."
5,32,47,"For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it."
5,32,48,"And Jehovah spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,"
5,32,49,"Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession;"
5,32,50,"and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:"
5,32,51,"because ye trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel."
5,32,52,"For thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither into the land which I give the children of Israel."
5,33,1,"And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death."
5,33,2,"And he said, Jehovah came from Sinai, And rose from Seir unto them; He shined forth from mount Paran, And he came from the ten thousands of holy ones: At his right hand was a fiery law for them."
5,33,3,"Yea, he loveth the people; All his saints are in thy hand: And they sat down at thy feet; `Every one' shall receive of thy words."
5,33,4,"Moses commanded us a law, An inheritance for the assembly of Jacob."
5,33,5,"And he was king in Jeshurun, When the heads of the people were gathered, All the tribes of Israel together."
5,33,6,"Let Reuben live, and not die; Nor let his men be few."
5,33,7,"And this is `the blessing' of Judah: and he said, Hear, Jehovah, the voice of Judah, And bring him in unto his people. With his hands he contended for himself; And thou shalt be a help against his adversaries."
5,33,8,"And of Levi he said, Thy Thummim and thy Urim are with thy godly one, Whom thou didst prove at Massah, With whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;"
5,33,9,"Who said of his father, and of his mother, I have not seen him; Neither did he acknowledge his brethren, Nor knew he his own children: For they have observed thy word, And keep thy covenant."
5,33,10,"They shall teach Jacob thine ordinances, And Israel thy law: They shall put incense before thee, And whole burnt-offering upon thine altar."
5,33,11,"Bless, Jehovah, his substance, And accept the work of his hands: Smite through the loins of them that rise up against him, And of them that hate him, that they rise not again."
5,33,12,"Of Benjamin he said, The beloved of Jehovah shall dwell in safety by him; He covereth him all the day long, And he dwelleth between his shoulders."
5,33,13,"And of Joseph he said, Blessed of Jehovah be his land, For the precious things of heaven, for the dew, And for the deep that coucheth beneath,"
5,33,14,"And for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, And for the precious things of the growth of the moons,"
5,33,15,"And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, And for the precious things of the everlasting hills,"
5,33,16,"And for the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof, And the good will of him that dwelt in the bush. Let `the blessing' come upon the head of Joseph, And upon the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren."
5,33,17,"The firstling of his herd, majesty is his; And his horns are the horns of the wild-ox: With them he shall push the peoples all of them, `even' the ends of the earth: And they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, And they are the thousands of Manasseh."
5,33,18,"And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; And, Issachar, in thy tents."
5,33,19,"They shall call the peoples unto the mountain; There shall they offer sacrifices of righteousness: For they shall suck the abundance of the seas, And the hidden treasures of the sand."
5,33,20,"And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: He dwelleth as a lioness, And teareth the arm, yea, the crown of the head."
5,33,21,"And he provided the first part for himself, For there was the lawgiver's portion reserved; And he came `with' the heads of the people; He executed the righteousness of Jehovah, And his ordinances with Israel."
5,33,22,"And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp, That leapeth forth from Bashan."
5,33,23,"And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, And full with the blessing of Jehovah, Possess thou the west and the south."
5,33,24,"And of Asher he said, Blessed be Asher with children; Let him be acceptable unto his brethren, And let him dip his foot in oil."
5,33,25,"Thy bars shall be iron and brass; And as thy days, so shall thy strength be."
5,33,26,"There is none like unto God, O Jeshurun, Who rideth upon the heavens for thy help, And in his excellency on the skies."
5,33,27,"The eternal God is `thy' dwelling-place, And underneath are the everlasting arms. And he thrust out the enemy from before thee, And said, Destroy."
5,33,28,"And Israel dwelleth in safety, The fountain of Jacob alone, In a land of grain and new wine; Yea, his heavens drop down dew."
5,33,29,"Happy art thou, O Israel: Who is like unto thee, a people saved by Jehovah, The shield of thy help, And the sword of thy excellency! And thine enemies shall submit themselves unto thee; And thou shalt tread upon their high places."
5,34,1,"And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And Jehovah showed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,"
5,34,2,"and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the hinder sea,"
5,34,3,"and the South, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm-trees, unto Zoar."
5,34,4,"And Jehovah said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither."
5,34,5,"So Moses the servant of Jehovah died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of Jehovah."
5,34,6,"And he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day."
5,34,7,"And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated."
5,34,8,"And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses were ended."
5,34,9,"And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as Jehovah commanded Moses."
5,34,10,"And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom Jehovah knew face to face,"
5,34,11,"in all the signs and the wonders, which Jehovah sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,"
5,34,12,"and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror, which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel."
6,1,1,"Now it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of Jehovah, that Jehovah spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying,"
6,1,2,"Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel."
6,1,3,"Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, to you have I given it, as I spake unto Moses."
6,1,4,"From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border."
6,1,5,"There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life. as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee; I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee."
6,1,6,"Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land which I sware unto their fathers to give them."
6,1,7,"Only be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest have good success whithersoever thou goest."
6,1,8,"This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate thereon day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success."
6,1,9,"Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of good courage; be not affrighted, neither be thou dismayed: for Jehovah thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest."
6,1,10,"Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,"
6,1,11,"Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye are to pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which Jehovah your God giveth you to possess it."
6,1,12,"And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,"
6,1,13,"Remember the word which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God giveth you rest, and will give you this land."
6,1,14,"Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall abide in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan; but ye shall pass over before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valor, and shall help them;"
6,1,15,"until Jehovah have given your brethren rest, as `he hath given' you, and they also have possessed the land which Jehovah your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and possess it, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising."
6,1,16,"And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou hast commanded us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go."
6,1,17,"According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only Jehovah thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses."
6,1,18,"Whosoever he be that shall rebel against thy commandment, and shall not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of good courage."
6,2,1,"And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men as spies secretly, saying, Go, view the land, and Jericho. And they went and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lay there."
6,2,2,"And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to-night of the children of Israel to search out the land."
6,2,3,"And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, that are entered into thy house; for they are come to search out all the land."
6,2,4,"And the woman took the two men, and hid them; and she said, Yea, the men came unto me, but I knew not whence they were:"
6,2,5,"and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out; whither the men went I know not: pursue after them quickly; for ye will overtake them."
6,2,6,"But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof."
6,2,7,"And the men pursued after them the way to the Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they that pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate."
6,2,8,"And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;"
6,2,9,"and she said unto the men, I know that Jehovah hath given you the land, and that the fear of you is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you."
6,2,10,"For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the water of the Red Sea before you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan, unto Sihon and to Og, whom ye utterly destroyed."
6,2,11,"And as soon as we had heard it, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you: for Jehovah your God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath."
6,2,12,"Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by Jehovah, since I have dealt kindly with you, that ye also will deal kindly with my father's house, and give me a true token;"
6,2,13,"and that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and will deliver our lives from death."
6,2,14,"And the men said unto her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business; and it shall be, when Jehovah giveth us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee."
6,2,15,"Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the side of the wall, and she dwelt upon the wall."
6,2,16,"And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers light upon you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way."
6,2,17,"And the men said unto her, We will be guiltless of this thine oath which thou hast made us to swear."
6,2,18,"Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt gather unto thee into the house thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household."
6,2,19,"And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we shall be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him."
6,2,20,"But if thou utter this our business, then we shall be guiltless of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear."
6,2,21,"And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window."
6,2,22,"And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not."
6,2,23,"Then the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had befallen them."
6,2,24,"And they said unto Joshua, Truly Jehovah hath delivered into our hands all the land; and moreover all the inhabitants of the land do melt away before us."
6,3,1,"And Joshua rose up early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel; and they lodged there before they passed over."
6,3,2,"And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the midst of the camp;"
6,3,3,"and they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it."
6,3,4,"Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go; for ye have not passed this way heretofore."
6,3,5,"And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow Jehovah will do wonders among you."
6,3,6,"And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people."
6,3,7,"And Jehovah said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee."
6,3,8,"And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, ye shall stand still in the Jordan."
6,3,9,"And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of Jehovah your God."
6,3,10,"And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite."
6,3,11,"Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into the Jordan."
6,3,12,"Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, for every tribe a man."
6,3,13,"And it shall come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of Jehovah, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off, even the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand in one heap."
6,3,14,"And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over the Jordan, the priests that bare the ark of the covenant being before the people;"
6,3,15,"and when they that bare the ark were come unto the Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brink of the water (for the Jordan overfloweth all its banks all the time of harvest,)"
6,3,16,"that the waters which came down from above stood, and rose up in one heap, a great way off, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan; and those that went down toward the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho."
6,3,17,"And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan; and all Israel passed over on dry ground, until all the nation were passed clean over the Jordan."
6,4,1,"And it came to pass, when all the nation were clean passed over the Jordan, that Jehovah spake unto Joshua, saying,"
6,4,2,"Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,"
6,4,3,"and command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the lodging-place, where ye shall lodge this night."
6,4,4,"Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:"
6,4,5,"and Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of Jehovah your God into the midst of the Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel;"
6,4,6,"that this may be a sign among you, that, when your children ask in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?"
6,4,7,"then ye shall say unto them, Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah; when it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever."
6,4,8,"And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as Jehovah spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel; and they carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there."
6,4,9,"And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests that bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day."
6,4,10,"For the priests that bare the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan, until everything was finished that Jehovah commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over."
6,4,11,"And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of Jehovah passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people."
6,4,12,"And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:"
6,4,13,"about forty thousand ready armed for war passed over before Jehovah unto battle, to the plains of Jericho."
6,4,14,"On that day Jehovah magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life."
6,4,15,"And Jehovah spake unto Joshua, saying,"
6,4,16,"Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan."
6,4,17,"Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of the Jordan."
6,4,18,"And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah were come up out of the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry ground, that the waters of the Jordan returned unto their place, and went over all its banks, as aforetime."
6,4,19,"And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east border of Jericho."
6,4,20,"And those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, did Joshua set up in Gilgal."
6,4,21,"And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?"
6,4,22,"Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land."
6,4,23,"For Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as Jehovah your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were passed over;"
6,4,24,"that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of Jehovah, that it is mighty; that ye may fear Jehovah your God for ever."
6,5,1,"And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, that were by the sea, heard how that Jehovah had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel."
6,5,2,"At that time Jehovah said unto Joshua, Make thee knives of flint, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time."
6,5,3,"And Joshua made him knives of lint, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins."
6,5,4,"And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: all the people that came forth out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came forth out of Egypt."
6,5,5,"For all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, they had not circumcised."
6,5,6,"For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the nation, even the men of war that came forth out of Egypt, were consumed, because they hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah: unto whom Jehovah sware that he would not let them see the land which Jehovah sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey."
6,5,7,"And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them did Joshua circumcise: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way."
6,5,8,"And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the nation, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole."
6,5,9,"And Jehovah said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of that place was called Gilgal, unto this day."
6,5,10,"And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal; and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho."
6,5,11,"And they did eat of the produce of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched grain, in the selfsame day."
6,5,12,"And the manna ceased on the morrow, after they had eaten of the produce of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year."
6,5,13,"And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?"
6,5,14,"And he said, Nay; but `as' prince of the host of Jehovah am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?"
6,5,15,"And the prince of Jehovah's host said unto Joshua, Put off thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so."
6,6,1,"Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in."
6,6,2,"And Jehovah said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thy hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valor."
6,6,3,"And ye shall compass the city, all the men of war, going about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days."
6,6,4,"And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets."
6,6,5,"And it shall be, that, when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him."
6,6,6,"And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of Jehovah."
6,6,7,"And they said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of Jehovah."
6,6,8,"And it was so, that, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before Jehovah passed on, and blew the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah followed them."
6,6,9,"And the armed men went before the priests that blew the trumpets, and the rearward went after the ark, `the priests' blowing the trumpets as they went."
6,6,10,"And Joshua commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout."
6,6,11,"So he caused the ark of Jehovah to compass the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp."
6,6,12,"And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Jehovah."
6,6,13,"And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of Jehovah went on continually, and blew the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; and the rearward came after the ark of Jehovah, `the priests' blowing the trumpets as they went."
6,6,14,"And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days."
6,6,15,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on the day they compassed the city seven times."
6,6,16,"And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for Jehovah hath given you the city."
6,6,17,"And the city shall be devoted, even it and all that is therein, to Jehovah: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent."
6,6,18,"But as for you, only keep yourselves from the devoted thing, lest when ye have devoted it, ye take of the devoted thing; so would ye make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it."
6,6,19,"But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are holy unto Jehovah: they shall come into the treasury of Jehovah."
6,6,20,"So the people shouted, and `the priests' blew the trumpets; and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city."
6,6,21,"And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword."
6,6,22,"And Joshua said unto the two men that had spied out the land, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her."
6,6,23,"And the young men the spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; all her kindred also they brought out; and they set them without the camp of Israel."
6,6,24,"And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein; only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah."
6,6,25,"But Rahab the harlot, and her father's household, and all that she had, did Joshua save alive; and she dwelt in the midst of Israel unto this day, because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho."
6,6,26,"And Joshua charged them with an oath at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before Jehovah, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: with the loss of his first-born shall he lay the foundation thereof, and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it."
6,6,27,"So Jehovah was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land."
6,7,1,"But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted thing; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted thing: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the children of Israel."
6,7,2,"And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and spy out the land. And the men went up and spied out Ai."
6,7,3,"And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; make not all the people to toil thither; for they are but few."
6,7,4,"So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai."
6,7,5,"And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men; and they chased them `from' before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them at the descent; and the hearts of the people melted, and became as water."
6,7,6,"And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of Jehovah until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust upon their heads."
6,7,7,"And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? would that we had been content and dwelt beyond the Jordan!"
6,7,8,"Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel hath turned their backs before their enemies!"
6,7,9,"For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will compass us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do for thy great name?"
6,7,10,"And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore art thou thus fallen upon thy face?"
6,7,11,"Israel hath sinned; yea, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: yea, they have even taken of the devoted thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also; and they have even put it among their own stuff."
6,7,12,"Therefore the children of Israel cannot stand before their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies, because they are become accursed: I will not be with you any more, except ye destroy the devoted thing from among you."
6,7,13,"Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow: for thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, There is a devoted thing in the midst of thee, O Israel; thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the devoted thing from among you."
6,7,14,"In the morning therefore ye shall be brought near by your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which Jehovah taketh shall come near by families; and the family which Jehovah shall take shall come near by households; and the household which Jehovah shall take shall come near man by man."
6,7,15,"And it shall be, that he that is taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath; because he hath transgressed the covenant of Jehovah, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel."
6,7,16,"So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel near by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:"
6,7,17,"and he brought near the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zerahites: and he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:"
6,7,18,"and he brought near his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken."
6,7,19,"And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to Jehovah, the God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me."
6,7,20,"And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Of a truth I have sinned against Jehovah, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:"
6,7,21,"when I saw among the spoil a goodly Babylonish mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it."
6,7,22,"So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it."
6,7,23,"And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel; and they laid them down before Jehovah."
6,7,24,"And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them up unto the valley of Achor."
6,7,25,"And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? Jehovah shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones."
6,7,26,"And they raised over him a great heap of stones, unto this day; and Jehovah turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day."
6,8,1,"And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land;"
6,8,2,"And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: set thee an ambush for the city behind it."
6,8,3,"So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valor, and sent them forth by night."
6,8,4,"And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city; go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:"
6,8,5,"and I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city. And it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them;"
6,8,6,"and they will come out after us, till we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: so we will flee before them;"
6,8,7,"and ye shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city: for Jehovah your God will deliver it into your hand."
6,8,8,"And it shall be, when ye have seized upon the city, that ye shall set the city on fire; according to the word of Jehovah shall ye do: see, I have commanded you."
6,8,9,"And Joshua sent them forth; and they went to the ambushment, and abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people."
6,8,10,"And Joshua arose up early in the morning, and mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai."
6,8,11,"And all the people, `even' the `men of' war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between him and Ai."
6,8,12,"And he took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city."
6,8,13,"So they set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers-in-wait that were on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley."
6,8,14,"And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the Arabah; but he knew not that there was an ambush against him behind the city."
6,8,15,"And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness."
6,8,16,"And all the people that were in the city were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city."
6,8,17,"And there was not a man left in Ai or Beth-el, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel."
6,8,18,"And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thy hand. And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city."
6,8,19,"And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it; and they hasted and set the city on fire."
6,8,20,"And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers."
6,8,21,"And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai."
6,8,22,"And the others came forth out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape."
6,8,23,"And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua."
6,8,24,"And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword."
6,8,25,"And all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai."
6,8,26,"For Joshua drew not back his hand, wherewith he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai."
6,8,27,"Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for prey unto themselves, according unto the word of Jehovah which he commanded Joshua."
6,8,28,"So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap for ever, even a desolation, unto this day."
6,8,29,"And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the eventide: and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised thereon a great heap of stones, unto this day."
6,8,30,"Then Joshua built an altar unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, in mount Ebal,"
6,8,31,"as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of unhewn stones, upon which no man had lifted up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt-offerings unto Jehovah, and sacrificed peace-offerings."
6,8,32,"And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote, in the presence of the children of Israel."
6,8,33,"And all Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, as well the sojourner as the homeborn; half of them in front of mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded at the first, that they should bless the people of Israel."
6,8,34,"And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law."
6,8,35,"There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the sojourners that were among them."
6,9,1,"And it came to pass, when all the kings that were beyond the Jordan, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof;"
6,9,2,"that they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord."
6,9,3,"But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai,"
6,9,4,"they also did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine-skins, old and rent and bound up,"
6,9,5,"and old and patched shoes upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and was become mouldy."
6,9,6,"And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We are come from a far country: now therefore make ye a covenant with us."
6,9,7,"And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a covenant with you?"
6,9,8,"And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?"
6,9,9,"And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of Jehovah thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,"
6,9,10,"and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth."
6,9,11,"And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take provision in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: and now make ye a covenant with us."
6,9,12,"This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and is become mouldy:"
6,9,13,"and these wine-skins, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they are rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey."
6,9,14,"And the men took of their provision, and asked not counsel at the mouth of Jehovah."
6,9,15,"And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them."
6,9,16,"And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they dwelt among them."
6,9,17,"And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim."
6,9,18,"And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by Jehovah, the God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes."
6,9,19,"But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by Jehovah, the God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them."
6,9,20,"This we will do to them, and let them live; lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them."
6,9,21,"And the princes said unto them, Let them live: so they became hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation, as the princes had spoken unto them."
6,9,22,"And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us?"
6,9,23,"Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall never fail to be of you bondmen, both hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God."
6,9,24,"And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that Jehovah thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; therefore we were sore afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing."
6,9,25,"And now, behold, we are in thy hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do."
6,9,26,"And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not."
6,9,27,"And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of Jehovah, unto this day, in the place which he should choose."
6,10,1,"Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;"
6,10,2,"that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty."
6,10,3,"Wherefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,"
6,10,4,"Come up unto me, and help me, and let us smite Gibeon; for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel."
6,10,5,"Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it."
6,10,6,"And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill-country are gathered together against us."
6,10,7,"So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor."
6,10,8,"And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thy hands; there shall not a man of them stand before thee."
6,10,9,"Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly; `for' he went up from Gilgal all the night."
6,10,10,"And Jehovah discomfited them before Israel, and he slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah."
6,10,11,"And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, that Jehovah cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword."
6,10,12,"Then spake Joshua to Jehovah in the day when Jehovah delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel; and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; And thou, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon."
6,10,13,"And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, Until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day."
6,10,14,"And there was no day like that before it or after it, that Jehovah hearkened unto the voice of a man: for Jehovah fought for Israel."
6,10,15,"And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal."
6,10,16,"And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah."
6,10,17,"And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah."
6,10,18,"And Joshua said, Roll great stones unto the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to keep them:"
6,10,19,"but stay not ye; pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for Jehovah your God hath delivered them into your hand."
6,10,20,"And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,"
6,10,21,"that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel."
6,10,22,"Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth those five kings unto me out of the cave."
6,10,23,"And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon."
6,10,24,"And it came to pass, when they brought forth those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the chiefs of the men of war that went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them."
6,10,25,"And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage: for thus shall Jehovah do to all your enemies against whom ye fight."
6,10,26,"And afterward Joshua smote them, and put them to death, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening."
6,10,27,"And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had hidden themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, unto this very day."
6,10,28,"And Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof: he utterly destroyed them and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining; and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done unto the king of Jericho."
6,10,29,"And Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:"
6,10,30,"and Jehovah delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining in it; and he did unto the king thereof as he had done unto the king of Jericho."
6,10,31,"And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:"
6,10,32,"and Jehovah delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel; and he took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah."
6,10,33,"Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining."
6,10,34,"And Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, unto Eglon; and they encamped against it, and fought against it;"
6,10,35,"and they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword; and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish."
6,10,36,"And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:"
6,10,37,"and they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it, and all the souls that were therein."
6,10,38,"And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and fought against it:"
6,10,39,"and he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to the king thereof."
6,10,40,"So Joshua smote all the land, the hill-country, and the South, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that breathed, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, commanded."
6,10,41,"And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon."
6,10,42,"And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because Jehovah, the God of Israel, fought for Israel."
6,10,43,"And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal."
6,11,1,"And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor heard thereof, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,"
6,11,2,"and to the kings that were on the north, in the hill-country, and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west,"
6,11,3,"to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the hill-country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah."
6,11,4,"And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea-shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many."
6,11,5,"And all these kings met together; and they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel."
6,11,6,"And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them; for to-morrow at this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hock their horses, and burn their chariots with fire."
6,11,7,"So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell upon them."
6,11,8,"And Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they smote them, and chased them unto great Sidon, and unto Misrephoth-maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining."
6,11,9,"And Joshua did unto them as Jehovah bade him: he hocked their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire."
6,11,10,"And Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms."
6,11,11,"And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them; there was none left that breathed: and he burnt Hazor with fire."
6,11,12,"And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and he smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded."
6,11,13,"But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn."
6,11,14,"And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any that breathed."
6,11,15,"As Jehovah commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua: and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that Jehovah commanded Moses."
6,11,16,"So Joshua took all that land, the hill-country, and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland, and the Arabah, and the hill-country of Israel, and the lowland of the same;"
6,11,17,"from mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and put them to death."
6,11,18,"Joshua made war a long time with all those kings."
6,11,19,"There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: they took all in battle."
6,11,20,"For it was of Jehovah to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that he might utterly destroy them, that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as Jehovah commanded Moses."
6,11,21,"And Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill-country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill-country of Judah, and from all the hill-country of Israel: Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities."
6,11,22,"There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, did some remain."
6,11,23,"So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Jehovah spake unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land had rest from war."
6,12,1,"Now these are the kings of the land, whom the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising, from the valley of the Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the Arabah eastward:"
6,12,2,"Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and `the city that is in' the middle of the valley, and half Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon;"
6,12,3,"and the Arabah unto the sea of Chinneroth, eastward, and unto the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, eastward, the way to Beth-jeshimoth; and on the south, under the slopes of Pisgah:"
6,12,4,"and the border of Og king of Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim, who dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,"
6,12,5,"and ruled in mount Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon."
6,12,6,"Moses the servant of Jehovah and the children of Israel smote them: and Moses the servant of Jehovah gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh."
6,12,7,"And these are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children of Israel smote beyond the Jordan westward, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon even unto mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir; and Joshua gave it unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions;"
6,12,8,"in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and in the Arabah, and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the South; the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:"
6,12,9,"the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;"
6,12,10,"the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;"
6,12,11,"the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;"
6,12,12,"the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;"
6,12,13,"the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;"
6,12,14,"the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;"
6,12,15,"the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;"
6,12,16,"the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;"
6,12,17,"the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;"
6,12,18,"the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lassharon, one;"
6,12,19,"the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;"
6,12,20,"the king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;"
6,12,21,"the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;"
6,12,22,"the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;"
6,12,23,"the king of Dor in the height of Dor, one; the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one;"
6,12,24,"the king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one."
6,13,1,"Now Joshua was old and well stricken in years; and Jehovah said unto him, Thou art old and well stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed."
6,13,2,"This is the land that yet remaineth: all the regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshurites;"
6,13,3,"from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the border of Ekron northward, `which' is reckoned to the Canaanites; the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazites, and the Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avvim,"
6,13,4,"on the south; all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that belongeth to the Sidonians, unto Aphek, to the border of the Amorites;"
6,13,5,"and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baal-gad under mount Hermon unto the entrance of Hamath;"
6,13,6,"all the inhabitants of the hill-country from Lebanon unto Misrephoth-maim, even all the Sidonians; them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only allot thou it unto Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee."
6,13,7,"Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half-tribe of Manasseh."
6,13,8,"With him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of Jehovah gave them:"
6,13,9,"from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon;"
6,13,10,"and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon;"
6,13,11,"and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salecah;"
6,13,12,"all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (the same was left of the remnant of the Rephaim); for these did Moses smite, and drove them out."
6,13,13,"Nevertheless the children of Israel drove not out the Geshurites, nor the Maacathites: but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel unto this day."
6,13,14,"Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance; the offerings of Jehovah, the God of Israel, made by fire are his inheritance, as he spake unto him."
6,13,15,"And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their families."
6,13,16,"And their border was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain by Medeba;"
6,13,17,"Heshbon, and all its cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon,"
6,13,18,"and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,"
6,13,19,"and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth-shahar in the mount of the valley,"
6,13,20,"and Beth-peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth,"
6,13,21,"and all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the princes of Sihon, that dwelt in the land."
6,13,22,"Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among the rest of their slain."
6,13,23,"And the border of the children of Reuben was the Jordan, and the border `thereof'. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families, the cities and the villages thereof."
6,13,24,"And Moses gave unto the tribe of Gad, unto the children of Gad, according to their families."
6,13,25,"And their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before Rabbah;"
6,13,26,"and from Heshbon unto Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;"
6,13,27,"and in the valley, Beth-haram, and Beth-nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, the Jordan and the border `thereof', unto the uttermost part of the sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan eastward."
6,13,28,"This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their families, the cities and the villages thereof."
6,13,29,"And Moses gave `inheritance' unto the half-tribe of Manasseh: and it was for the half-tribe of the children of Manasseh according to their families."
6,13,30,"And their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities:"
6,13,31,"and half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even for the half of the children of Machir according to their families."
6,13,32,"These are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho, eastward."
6,13,33,"But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance: Jehovah, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, as he spake unto them."
6,14,1,"And these are the inheritances which the children of Israel took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers' `houses' of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed unto them,"
6,14,2,"by the lot of their inheritance, as Jehovah commanded by Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe."
6,14,3,"For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave no inheritance among them."
6,14,4,"For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: and they gave no portion unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for their cattle and for their substance."
6,14,5,"As Jehovah commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did; and they divided the land."
6,14,6,"Then the children of Judah drew nigh unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that Jehovah spake unto Moses the man of God concerning me and concerning thee in Kadesh-barnea."
6,14,7,"Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of Jehovah sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in my heart."
6,14,8,"Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed Jehovah my God."
6,14,9,"And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy foot hath trodden shall be an inheritance to thee and to thy children for ever, because thou hast wholly followed Jehovah my God."
6,14,10,"And now, behold, Jehovah hath kept me alive, as he spake, these forty and five years, from the time that Jehovah spake this word unto Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old."
6,14,11,"As yet I am as strong this day as I as in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, and to go out and to come in."
6,14,12,"Now therefore give me this hill-country, whereof Jehovah spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakim were there, and cities great and fortified: it may be that Jehovah will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as Jehovah spake."
6,14,13,"And Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance."
6,14,14,"Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite unto this day; because that he wholly followed Jehovah, the God of Israel."
6,14,15,"Now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kiriath-arba; `which Arba was' the greatest man among the Anakim. And the land had rest from war."
6,15,1,"And the lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families was unto the border of Edom, even to the wilderness of Zin southward, at the uttermost part of the south."
6,15,2,"And their south border was from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea, from the bay that looketh southward;"
6,15,3,"and it went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and went up by the south of Kadesh-barnea, and passed along by Hezron, and went up to Addar, and turned about to Karka;"
6,15,4,"and it passed along to Azmon, and went out at the brook of Egypt; and the goings out of the border were at the sea: this shall be your south border."
6,15,5,"And the east border was the Salt Sea, even unto the end of the Jordan. And the border of the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan;"
6,15,6,"and the border went up to Beth-hoglah, and passed along by the north of Beth-arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben;"
6,15,7,"and the border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is over against the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the river; and the border passed along to the waters of En-shemesh, and the goings out thereof were at En-rogel;"
6,15,8,"and the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the side of the Jebusite southward (the same is Jerusalem); and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the uttermost part of the vale of Rephaim northward;"
6,15,9,"and the border extended from the top of the mountain unto the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border extended to Baalah (the same is Kiriath-jearim);"
6,15,10,"and the border turned about from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim on the north (the same is Chesalon), and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed along by Timnah;"
6,15,11,"and the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward; and the border extended to Shikkeron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out at Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea."
6,15,12,"And the west border was to the great sea, and the border `thereof'. This is the border of the children of Judah round about according to their families."
6,15,13,"And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a portion among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of Jehovah to Joshua, even Kiriath-arba, `which Arba was' the father of Anak (the same is Hebron)."
6,15,14,"And Caleb drove out thence the three sons of Anak: Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak."
6,15,15,"And he went up thence against the inhabitants of Debir: now the name of Debir beforetime was Kiriath-sepher."
6,15,16,"And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife."
6,15,17,"And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife."
6,15,18,"And it came to pass, when she came `unto him', that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she alighted from off her ass; and Caleb said, What wouldest thou?"
6,15,19,"And she said, Give me a blessing; for that thou hast set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs and the nether springs."
6,15,20,"This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families."
6,15,21,"And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the border of Edom in the South were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,"
6,15,22,"and Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,"
6,15,23,"and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,"

6,15,46,"from Ekron even unto the sea, all that were by the side of Ashdod, with their villages."
6,15,47,"Ashdod, its towns and its villages; Gaza, its towns and its villages; unto the brook of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border `thereof'."
6,15,48,"And in the hill-country, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,"
6,15,49,"and Dannah, and Kiriath-sannah (the same is Debir),"
6,15,50,"and Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,"
6,15,51,"and Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages."

6,15,62,"and Nibshan, and the City of Salt, and En-gedi; six cities with their villages."
6,15,63,"And as for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out: but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day."
6,16,1,"And the lot came out for the children of Joseph from the Jordan at Jericho, at the waters of Jericho on the east, even the wilderness, going up from Jericho through the hill-country to Beth-el;"
6,16,2,"and it went out from Beth-el to Luz, and passed along unto the border of the Archites to Ataroth;"
6,16,3,"and it went down westward to the border of the Japhletites, unto the border of Beth-horon the nether, even unto Gezer; and the goings out thereof were at the sea."
6,16,4,"And the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance."
6,16,5,"And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was `thus': the border of their inheritance eastward was Ataroth-addar, unto Beth-horon the upper;"
6,16,6,"and the border went out westward at Michmethath on the north; and the border turned about eastward unto Taanath-shiloh, and passed along it on the east of Janoah;"
6,16,7,"and it went down from Janoah to Ataroth, and to Naarah, and reached unto Jericho, and went out at the Jordan."
6,16,8,"From Tappuah the border went along westward to the brook of Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their families;"
6,16,9,"together with the cities which were set apart for the children of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages."
6,16,10,"And they drove not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell in the midst of Ephraim unto this day, and are become servants to do taskwork."
6,17,1,"And `this' was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the first-born of Joseph. As for Machir the first-born of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan."
6,17,2,"So `the lot' was for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families: for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families."
6,17,3,"But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah."
6,17,4,"And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, Jehovah commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren: therefore according to the commandment of Jehovah he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father."
6,17,5,"And there fell ten parts to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan;"
6,17,6,"because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons. And the land of Gilead belonged unto the rest of the sons of Manasseh."
6,17,7,"And the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, which is before Shechem; and the border went along to the right hand, unto the inhabitants of En-tappuah."
6,17,8,"The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh; but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim."
6,17,9,"And the border went down unto the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook: these cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh: and the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook, and the goings out thereof were at the sea:"
6,17,10,"southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's, and the sea was his border; and they reached to Asher on the north, and to Issachar on the east."
6,17,11,"And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, even the three heights."
6,17,12,"Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out `the inhabitants of' those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land."
6,17,13,"And it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxed strong, that they put the Canaanites to taskwork, and did not utterly drive them out."
6,17,14,"And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as hitherto Jehovah hath blessed me?"
6,17,15,"And Joshua said unto them, If thou be a great people, get thee up to the forest, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the hill-country of Ephraim is too narrow for thee."
6,17,16,"And the children of Joseph said, The hill-country is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are in Beth-shean and its towns, and they who are in the valley of Jezreel."
6,17,17,"And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power; thou shalt not have one lot only:"
6,17,18,"but the hill-country shall be thine; for though it is a forest, thou shalt cut it down, and the goings out thereof shall be thine; for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong."
6,18,1,"And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there: and the land was subdued before them."
6,18,2,"And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet divided their inheritance."
6,18,3,"And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye slack to go in to possess the land, which Jehovah, the God of your fathers, hath given you?"
6,18,4,"Appoint for you three men of each tribe: and I will send them, and they shall arise, and walk through the land, and describe it according to their inheritance; and they shall come unto me."
6,18,5,"And they shall divide it into seven portions: Judah shall abide in his border on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their border on the north."
6,18,6,"And ye shall describe the land into seven portions, and bring `the description' hither to me; and I will cast lots for you here before Jehovah our God."
6,18,7,"For the Levites have no portion among you; for the priesthood of Jehovah is their inheritance: and Gad and Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave them."
6,18,8,"And the men arose, and went: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me; and I will cast lots for you here before Jehovah in Shiloh."
6,18,9,"And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven portions in a book; and they came to Joshua unto the camp at Shiloh."
6,18,10,"And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Jehovah: and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions."
6,18,11,"And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the border of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph."
6,18,12,"And their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the hill-country westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Beth-aven."
6,18,13,"And the border passed along from thence to Luz, to the side of Luz (the same is Beth-el), southward; and the border went down to Ataroth-addar, by the mountain that lieth on the south of Beth-horon the nether."
6,18,14,"And the border extended `thence', and turned about on the west quarter southward, from the mountain that lieth before Beth-horon southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kiriath-baal (the same is Kiriath-jearim), a city of the children of Judah: this was the west quarter."
6,18,15,"And the south quarter was from the uttermost part of Kiriath-jearim; and the border went out westward, and went out to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah;"
6,18,16,"and the border went down to the uttermost part of the mountain that lieth before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is in the vale of Rephaim northward; and it went down to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite southward, and went down to En-rogel;"
6,18,17,"and it extended northward, and went out at En-shemesh, and went out to Geliloth, which is over against the ascent of Adummim; and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben;"
6,18,18,"and it passed along to the side over against the Arabah northward, and went down unto the Arabah;"
6,18,19,"and the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward; and the goings out of the border were at the north bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan: this was the south border."
6,18,20,"And the Jordan was the border of it on the east quarter. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the borders thereof round about, according to their families."
6,18,21,"Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Beth-hoglah, and Emek-keziz,"
6,18,22,"and Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, and Beth-el,"
6,18,23,"and Avvim, and Parah, and Ophrah,"
6,18,24,"and Chephar-ammoni, and Ophni, and Geba; twelve cities with their villages:"
6,18,25,"Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,"
6,18,26,"and Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,"
6,18,27,"and Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,"
6,18,28,"and Zelah, Eleph, and the Jebusite (the same is Jerusalem), Gibeath, `and' Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families."
6,19,1,"And the second lot came out for Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Judah."
6,19,2,"And they had for their inheritance Beer-sheba, or Sheba, and Moladah,"
6,19,3,"and Hazar-shual, and Balah, and Ezem,"
6,19,4,"and Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,"
6,19,5,"and Ziklag, and Beth-marcaboth, and Hazar-susah,"
6,19,6,"and Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities with their villages:"
6,19,7,"Ain, Rimmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities with their villages:"
6,19,8,"and all the villages that were round about these cities to Baalath-beer, Ramah of the South. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families."
6,19,9,"Out of the part of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon; for the portion of the children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance."
6,19,10,"And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families; and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid;"
6,19,11,"and their border went up westward, even to Maralah, and reached to Dabbesheth; and it reached to the brook that is before Jokneam;"
6,19,12,"and it turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border of Chisloth-tabor; and it went out to Daberath, and went up to Japhia;"
6,19,13,"and from thence it passed along eastward to Gath-hepher, to Eth-kazin; and it went out at Rimmon which stretcheth unto Neah;"
6,19,14,"and the border turned about it on the north to Hannathon; and the goings out thereof were at the valley of Iphtah-el;"
6,19,15,"and Kattath, and Nahalal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages."
6,19,16,"This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages."
6,19,17,"The fourth lot came out for Issachar, even for the children of Issachar according to their families."
6,19,18,"And their border was unto Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,"
6,19,19,"and Hapharaim, and Shion, and Anaharath,"
6,19,20,"and Rabbith, and Kishion, and Ebez,"
6,19,21,"and Remeth, and Engannim, and En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez,"
6,19,22,"and the border reached to Tabor, and Shahazumah, and Beth-shemesh; and the goings out of their border were at the Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages."
6,19,23,"This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families, the cities with their villages."
6,19,24,"And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families."
6,19,25,"And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,"
6,19,26,"and Allammelech, and Amad, and Mishal; and it reached to Carmel westward, and to Shihor-libnath;"
6,19,27,"and it turned toward the sunrising to Beth-dagon, and reached to Zebulun, and to the valley of Iphtah-el northward to Beth-emek and Neiel; and it went out to Cabul on the left hand,"
6,19,28,"and Ebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even unto great Sidon;"
6,19,29,"and the border turned to Ramah, and to the fortified city of Tyre; and the border turned to Hosah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea by the region of Achzib;"
6,19,30,"Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with their villages."
6,19,31,"This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages."
6,19,32,"The sixth lot came out for the children of Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali according to their families."
6,19,33,"And their border was from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim, and Adaminekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakkum; and the goings out thereof were at the Jordan;"
6,19,34,"and the border turned westward to Aznoth-tabor, and went out from thence to Hukkok; and it reached to Zebulun on the south, and reached to Asher on the west, and to Judah at the Jordan toward the sunrising."
6,19,35,"And the fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,"
6,19,36,"and Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,"

6,19,46,"and Me-jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border over against Joppa."
6,19,47,"And the border of the children of Dan went out beyond them; for the children of Dan went up and fought against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father."
6,19,48,"This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages."
6,19,49,"So they made an end of distributing the land for inheritance by the borders thereof; and the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun in the midst of them:"
6,19,50,"according to the commandment of Jehovah they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnath-serah in the hill-country of Ephraim; and he built the city, and dwelt therein."
6,19,51,"These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers' `houses' of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot in Shiloh before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of meeting. So they made an end of dividing the land."
6,20,1,"And Jehovah spake unto Joshua, saying,"
6,20,2,"Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Assign you the cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by Moses,"
6,20,3,"that the manslayer that killeth any person unwittingly `and' unawares may flee thither: and they shall be unto you for a refuge from the avenger of blood."
6,20,4,"And he shall flee unto one of those cities, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city; and they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them."
6,20,5,"And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver up the manslayer into his hand; because he smote his neighbor unawares, and hated him not beforetime."
6,20,6,"And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days: then shall the manslayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled."
6,20,7,"And they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill-country of Naphtali, and Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron) in the hill-country of Judah."
6,20,8,"And beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness in the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh."
6,20,9,"These were the appointed cities for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that whosoever killeth any person unwittingly might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation."
6,21,1,"Then came near the heads of fathers' `houses' of the Levites unto Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads of fathers' `houses' of the tribes of the children of Israel;"
6,21,2,"and they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, Jehovah commanded Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle."
6,21,3,"And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance, according to the commandment of Jehovah, these cities with their suburbs."
6,21,4,"And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of the Simeonites, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities."
6,21,5,"And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, ten cities."
6,21,6,"And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities."
6,21,7,"The children of Merari according to their families had out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities."
6,21,8,"And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as Jehovah commanded by Moses."
6,21,9,"And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are `here' mentioned by name:"
6,21,10,"and they were for the children of Aaron, of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi; for theirs was the first lot."
6,21,11,"And they gave them Kiriath-arba, `which Arba was' the father of Anak (the same is Hebron), in the hill-country of Judah, with the suburbs thereof round about it."
6,21,12,"But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession."
6,21,13,"And unto the children of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Libnah with its suburbs,"
6,21,14,"and Jattir with its suburbs, and Eshtemoa with its suburbs,"
6,21,15,"and Holon with its suburbs, and Debir with its suburbs,"
6,21,16,"and Ain with its suburbs, and Juttah with its suburbs, `and' Beth-shemesh with its suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes."
6,21,17,"And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its suburbs, Geba with its suburbs,"
6,21,18,"Anathoth with its suburbs, and Almon with its suburbs; four cities."
6,21,19,"All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their suburbs."
6,21,20,"And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites, even the rest of the children of Kohath, they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim."
6,21,21,"And they gave them Shechem with its suburbs in the hill-country of Ephraim, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Gezer with its suburbs,"
6,21,22,"and Kibzaim with its suburbs, and Beth-horon with its suburbs; four cities."
6,21,23,"And out of the tribe of Dan, Elteke with its suburbs, Gibbethon with its suburbs,"
6,21,24,"Aijalon with its suburbs, Gath-rimmon with its suburbs; four cities."
6,21,25,"And out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Taanach with its suburbs, and Gath-rimmon with its suburbs; two cities."
6,21,26,"All the cities of the families of the rest of the children of Kohath were ten with their suburbs."
6,21,27,"And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the half-tribe of Manasseh `they gave' Golan in Bashan with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Be-eshterah with its suburbs; two cities."
6,21,28,"And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishion with its suburbs, Daberath with its suburbs,"
6,21,29,"Jarmuth with its suburbs, En-gannim with its suburbs; four cities."
6,21,30,"And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its suburbs, Abdon with its suburbs,"
6,21,31,"Helkath with its suburbs, and Rehob with its suburbs; four cities."
6,21,32,"And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Hammoth-dor with its suburbs, and Kartan with its suburbs; three cities."
6,21,33,"All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their suburbs."
6,21,34,"And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its suburbs, and Kartah with its suburbs,"
6,21,35,"Dimnah with its suburbs, Nahalal with its suburbs; four cities."
6,21,36,"And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with its suburbs, and Jahaz with its suburbs,"
6,21,37,"Kedemoth with its suburbs, and Mephaath with its suburbs; four cities."
6,21,38,"And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Mahanaim with its suburbs,"
6,21,39,"Heshbon with its suburbs, Jazer with its suburbs; four cities in all."
6,21,40,"All `these were' the cities of the children of Merari according to their families, even the rest of the families of the Levites; and their lot was twelve cities."
6,21,41,"All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs."
6,21,42,"These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus it was with all these cities."
6,21,43,"So Jehovah gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein."
6,21,44,"And Jehovah gave them rest round about, according to all that he sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; Jehovah delivered all their enemies into their hand."
6,21,45,"There failed not aught of any good thing which Jehovah had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass."
6,22,1,"Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,"
6,22,2,"and said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, and have hearkened unto my voice in all that I commanded you:"
6,22,3,"ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of Jehovah your God."
6,22,4,"And now Jehovah your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he spake unto them: therefore now turn ye, and get you unto your tents, unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you beyond the Jordan."
6,22,5,"Only take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, to love Jehovah your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul."
6,22,6,"So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went unto their tents."
6,22,7,"Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given `inheritance' in Bashan; but unto the other half gave Joshua among their brethren beyond the Jordan westward; moreover when Joshua sent them away unto their tents, he blessed them,"
6,22,8,"and spake unto them, saying, Return with much wealth unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren."
6,22,9,"And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the commandment of Jehovah by Moses."
6,22,10,"And when they came unto the region about the Jordan, that is in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan, a great altar to look upon."
6,22,11,"And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar in the forefront of the land of Canaan, in the region about the Jordan, on the side that pertaineth to the children of Israel."
6,22,12,"And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up against them to war."
6,22,13,"And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,"
6,22,14,"and with him ten princes, one prince of a fathers' house for each of the tribes of Israel; and they were every one of them head of their fathers' houses among the thousands of Israel."
6,22,15,"And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,"
6,22,16,"Thus saith the whole congregation of Jehovah, What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following Jehovah, in that ye have builded you an altar, to rebel this day against Jehovah?"
6,22,17,"Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves unto this day, although there came a plague upon the congregation of Jehovah,"
6,22,18,"that ye must turn away this day from following Jehovah? and it will be, seeing ye rebel to-day against Jehovah, that to-morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel."
6,22,19,"Howbeit, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of Jehovah, wherein Jehovah's tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against Jehovah, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar besides the altar of Jehovah our God."
6,22,20,"Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity."
6,22,21,"Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spake unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,"
6,22,22,"The Mighty One, God, Jehovah, the Mighty One, God, Jehovah, he knoweth; and Israel he shall know: if it be in rebellion, or if in trespass against Jehovah (save thou us not this day,)"
6,22,23,"that we have built us an altar to turn away from following Jehovah; or if to offer thereon burnt-offering or meal-offering, or if to offer sacrifices of peace-offerings thereon, let Jehovah himself require it;"
6,22,24,"and if we have not `rather' out of carefulness done this, `and' of purpose, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with Jehovah, the God of Israel?"
6,22,25,"for Jehovah hath made the Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no portion in Jehovah: so might your children make our children cease from fearing Jehovah."
6,22,26,"Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice:"
6,22,27,"but it shall be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we may do the service of Jehovah before him with our burnt-offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no portion in Jehovah."
6,22,28,"Therefore said we, It shall be, when they so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we shall say, Behold the pattern of the altar of Jehovah, which our fathers made, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a witness between us and you."
6,22,29,"Far be it from us that we should rebel against Jehovah, and turn away this day from following Jehovah, to build an altar for burnt-offering, for meal-offering, or for sacrifice, besides the altar of Jehovah our God that is before his tabernacle."
6,22,30,"And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them well."
6,22,31,"And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we know that Jehovah is in the midst of us, because ye have not committed this trespass against Jehovah: now have ye delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of Jehovah."
6,22,32,"And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again."
6,22,33,"And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and spake no more of going up against them to war, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and the children of Gad dwelt."
6,22,34,"And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar `Ed': For, `said they', it is a witness between us that Jehovah is God."
6,23,1,"And it came to pass after many days, when Jehovah had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, and Joshua was old and well stricken in years;"
6,23,2,"that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and for their heads, and for their judges and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old and well stricken in years:"
6,23,3,"and ye have seen all that Jehovah your God hath done unto all these nations because of you; for Jehovah your God, he it is that hath fought for you."
6,23,4,"Behold, I have allotted unto you these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun."
6,23,5,"And Jehovah your God, he will thrust them out from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as Jehovah your God spake unto you."
6,23,6,"Therefore be ye very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;"
6,23,7,"that ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear `by them', neither serve them, nor bow down yourselves unto them;"
6,23,8,"but cleave unto Jehovah your God, as ye have done unto this day."
6,23,9,"For Jehovah hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man hath stood before you unto this day."
6,23,10,"One man of you shall chase a thousand; for Jehovah your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he spake unto you."
6,23,11,"Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love Jehovah your God."
6,23,12,"Else if ye do at all go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you;"
6,23,13,"know for a certainty that Jehovah your God will no more drive these nations from out of your sight; but they shall be a snare and a trap unto you, and a scourge in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which Jehovah your God hath given you."
6,23,14,"And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which Jehovah your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, not one thing hath failed thereof."
6,23,15,"And it shall come to pass, that as all the good things are come upon you of which Jehovah your God spake unto you, so will Jehovah bring upon you all the evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which Jehovah your God hath given you."
6,23,16,"When ye transgress the covenant of Jehovah your God, which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods, and bow down yourselves to them; then will the anger of Jehovah be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you."
6,24,1,"And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God."
6,24,2,"And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt of old time beyond the River, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor: and they served other gods."
6,24,3,"And I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac."
6,24,4,"And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it: and Jacob and his children went down into Egypt."
6,24,5,"And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did in the midst thereof: and afterward I brought you out."
6,24,6,"And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and with horsemen unto the Red Sea."
6,24,7,"And when they cried out unto Jehovah, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness many days."
6,24,8,"And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, that dwelt beyond the Jordan: and they fought with you; and I gave them into your hand, and ye possessed their land; and I destroyed them from before you."
6,24,9,"Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel: and he sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you;"
6,24,10,"but I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand."
6,24,11,"And ye went over the Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your hand."
6,24,12,"And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; not with thy sword, nor with thy bow."
6,24,13,"And I gave you a land whereon thou hadst not labored, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell therein; of vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat."
6,24,14,"Now therefore fear Jehovah, and serve him in sincerity and in truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt; and serve ye Jehovah."
6,24,15,"And if it seem evil unto you to serve Jehovah, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah."
6,24,16,"And the people answered and said, Far be it from us that we should forsake Jehovah, to serve other gods;"
6,24,17,"for Jehovah our God, he it is that brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and that did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the peoples through the midst of whom we passed;"
6,24,18,"and Jehovah drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites that dwelt in the land: therefore we also will serve Jehovah; for he is our God."
6,24,19,"And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve Jehovah; for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgression nor your sins."
6,24,20,"If ye forsake Jehovah, and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you evil, and consume you, after that he hath done you good."
6,24,21,"And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve Jehovah."
6,24,22,"And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you Jehovah, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses."
6,24,23,"Now therefore put away, `said he', the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto Jehovah, the God of Israel."
6,24,24,"And the people said unto Joshua, Jehovah our God will we serve, and unto his voice will we hearken."
6,24,25,"So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem."
6,24,26,"And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Jehovah."
6,24,27,"And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it hath heard all the words of Jehovah which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness against you, lest ye deny your God."
6,24,28,"So Joshua sent the people away, every man unto his inheritance."
6,24,29,"And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, being a hundred and ten years old."
6,24,30,"And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash."
6,24,31,"And Israel served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, and had known all the work of Jehovah, that he had wrought for Israel."
6,24,32,"And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money: and they became the inheritance of the children of Joseph."
6,24,33,"And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the hill-country of Ephraim."
7,1,1,"And it came to pass after the death of Joshua, that the children of Israel asked of Jehovah, saying, Who shall go up for us first against the Canaanites, to fight against them?"
7,1,2,"And Jehovah said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand."
7,1,3,"And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him."
7,1,4,"And Judah went up; and Jehovah delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they smote of them in Bezek ten thousand men."
7,1,5,"And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek; and they fought against him, and they smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites."
7,1,6,"But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes."
7,1,7,"And Adoni-bezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered `their food' under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there."
7,1,8,"And the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire."
7,1,9,"And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites that dwelt in the hill-country, and in the South, and in the lowland."
7,1,10,"And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron (now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kiriath-arba); and they smote Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai."
7,1,11,"And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir. (Now the name of Debir beforetime was Kiriath-sepher.)"
7,1,12,"And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife."
7,1,13,"And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife."
7,1,14,"And it came to pass, when she came `unto him', that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she alighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?"
7,1,15,"And she said unto him, Give me a blessing; for that thou hast set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs."
7,1,16,"And the children of the Kenite, Moses' brother-in-law, went up out of the city of palm-trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt with the people."
7,1,17,"And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they smote the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah."
7,1,18,"Also Judah took Gaza with the border thereof, and Ashkelon with the border thereof, and Ekron with the border thereof."
7,1,19,"And Jehovah was with Judah; and drove out `the inhabitants of' the hill-country; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron."
7,1,20,"And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses had spoken: and he drove out thence the three sons of Anak."
7,1,21,"And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day."
7,1,22,"And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth-el; and Jehovah was with them."
7,1,23,"And the house of Joseph sent to spy out Beth-el. (Now the name of the city beforetime was Luz.)"
7,1,24,"And the watchers saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will deal kindly with thee."
7,1,25,"And he showed them the entrance into the city; and they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man go and all his family."
7,1,26,"And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz, which is the name thereof unto this day."
7,1,27,"And Manasseh did not drive out `the inhabitants of' Beth-shean and its towns, nor `of' Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land."
7,1,28,"And it came to pass, when Israel was waxed strong, that they put the Canaanites to taskwork, and did not utterly drive them out."
7,1,29,"And Ephraim drove not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them."
7,1,30,"Zebulun drove not out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became subject to taskwork."
7,1,31,"Asher drove not out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob;"
7,1,32,"but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out."
7,1,33,"Naphtali drove not out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became subject to taskwork."
7,1,34,"And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill-country; for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley;"
7,1,35,"but the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became subject to taskwork."
7,1,36,"And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward."
7,2,1,"And the angel of Jehovah came up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you:"
7,2,2,"and ye shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall break down their altars. But ye have not hearkened unto my voice: why have ye done this?"
7,2,3,"Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be `as thorns' in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you."
7,2,4,"And it came to pass, when the angel of Jehovah spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept."
7,2,5,"And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto Jehovah."
7,2,6,"Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land."
7,2,7,"And the people served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of Jehovah that he had wrought for Israel."
7,2,8,"And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, being a hundred and ten years old."
7,2,9,"And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash."
7,2,10,"And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, that knew not Jehovah, nor yet the work which he had wrought for Israel."
7,2,11,"And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and served the Baalim;"
7,2,12,"and they forsook Jehovah, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples that were round about them, and bowed themselves down unto them: and they provoked Jehovah to anger."
7,2,13,"And they forsook Jehovah, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth."
7,2,14,"And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that despoiled them; and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies."
7,2,15,"Whithersoever they went out, the hand of Jehovah was against them for evil, as Jehovah had spoken, and as Jehovah had sworn unto them: and they were sore distressed."
7,2,16,"And Jehovah raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those that despoiled them."
7,2,17,"And yet they hearkened not unto their judges; for they played the harlot after other gods, and bowed themselves down unto them: they turned aside quickly out of the way wherein their fathers walked, obeying the commandments of Jehovah; `but' they did not so."
7,2,18,"And when Jehovah raised them up judges, then Jehovah was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented Jehovah because of their groaning by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them."
7,2,19,"But it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their doings, nor from their stubborn way."
7,2,20,"And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel; and he said, Because this nation have transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;"
7,2,21,"I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations that Joshua left when he died;"
7,2,22,"that by them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of Jehovah to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not."
7,2,23,"So Jehovah left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua."
7,3,1,"Now these are the nations which Jehovah left, to prove Israel by them, even as many `of Israel' as had not known all the wars of Canaan;"
7,3,2,"only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as beforetime knew nothing thereof:"
7,3,3,"`namely', the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entrance of Hamath."
7,3,4,"And they were `left', to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of Jehovah, which he commanded their fathers by Moses."
7,3,5,"And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites:"
7,3,6,"and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods."
7,3,7,"And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and forgat Jehovah their God, and served the Baalim and the Asheroth."
7,3,8,"Therefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years."
7,3,9,"And when the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah, Jehovah raised up a saviour to the children of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother."
7,3,10,"And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and Jehovah delivered Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand: and his hand prevailed against Cushan-rishathaim."
7,3,11,"And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died."
7,3,12,"And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and Jehovah strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah."
7,3,13,"And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and smote Israel, and they possessed the city of palm-trees."
7,3,14,"And the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years."
7,3,15,"But when the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah, Jehovah raised them up a saviour, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a man left-handed. And the children of Israel sent tribute by him unto Eglon the king of Moab."
7,3,16,"And Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh."
7,3,17,"And he offered the tribute unto Eglon king of Moab: now Eglon was a very fat man."
7,3,18,"And when he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away the people that bare the tribute."
7,3,19,"But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king. And he said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him."
7,3,20,"And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat."
7,3,21,"And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body:"
7,3,22,"and the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, for he drew not the sword out of his body; and it came out behind."
7,3,23,"Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room upon him, and locked them."
7,3,24,"Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw, and, behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; and they said, Surely he is covering his feet in the upper chamber."
7,3,25,"And they tarried till they were ashamed; and, behold, he opened not the doors of the upper room: therefore they took the key, and opened `them', and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth."
7,3,26,"And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirah."
7,3,27,"And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the hill-country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill-country, and he before them."
7,3,28,"And he said unto them, Follow after me; for Jehovah hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and suffered not a man to pass over."
7,3,29,"And they smote of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, every lusty man, and every man of valor; and there escaped not a man."
7,3,30,"So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years."
7,3,31,"And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who smote of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad: and he also saved Israel."
7,4,1,"And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, when Ehud was dead."
7,4,2,"And Jehovah sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles."
7,4,3,"And the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel."
7,4,4,"Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged Israel at that time."
7,4,5,"And she dwelt under the palm-tree of Deborah between Ramah and Beth-el in the hill-country of Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment."
7,4,6,"And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said unto him, Hath not Jehovah, the God of Israel, commanded, `saying', Go and draw unto mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?"
7,4,7,"And I will draw unto thee, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thy hand."
7,4,8,"And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go; but if thou wilt not go with me, I will not go."
7,4,9,"And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding, the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honor; for Jehovah will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh."
7,4,10,"And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him."
7,4,11,"Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab the brother-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh."
7,4,12,"And they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor."
7,4,13,"And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, unto the river Kishon."
7,4,14,"And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which Jehovah hath delivered Sisera into thy hand; is not Jehovah gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him."
7,4,15,"And Jehovah discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet."
7,4,16,"But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left."
7,4,17,"Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite."
7,4,18,"And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And he turned in unto her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug."
7,4,19,"And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him."
7,4,20,"And he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No."
7,4,21,"Then Jael Heber's wife took a tent-pin, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died."
7,4,22,"And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest. And he came unto her; and, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent-pin was in his temples."
7,4,23,"So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel."
7,4,24,"And the hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan."
7,5,1,"Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,"
7,5,2,"For that the leaders took the lead in Israel, For that the people offered themselves willingly, Bless ye Jehovah."
7,5,3,"Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, `even' I, will sing unto Jehovah; I will sing praise to Jehovah, the God of Israel."
7,5,4,"Jehovah, when thou wentest forth out of Seir, When thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, The earth trembled, the heavens also dropped, Yea, the clouds dropped water."
7,5,5,"The mountains quaked at the presence of Jehovah, Even yon Sinai at the presence of Jehovah, the God of Israel."
7,5,6,"In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, In the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, And the travellers walked through byways."
7,5,7,"The rulers ceased in Israel, they ceased, Until that I Deborah arose, That I arose a mother in Israel."
7,5,8,"They chose new gods; Then was war in the gates: Was there a shield or spear seen Among forty thousand in Israel?"
7,5,9,"My heart is toward the governors of Israel, That offered themselves willingly among the people: Bless ye Jehovah."
7,5,10,"Tell `of it', ye that ride on white asses, Ye that sit on rich carpets, And ye that walk by the way."
7,5,11,"Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing water, There shall they rehearse the righteous acts of Jehovah, `Even' the righteous acts of his rule in Israel. Then the people of Jehovah went down to the gates."
7,5,12,"Awake, awake, Deborah; Awake, awake, utter a song: Arise, Barak, and lead away thy captives, thou son of Abinoam."
7,5,13,"Then came down a remnant of the nobles `and' the people; Jehovah came down for me against the mighty."
7,5,14,"Out of Ephraim `came down' they whose root is in Amalek; After thee, Benjamin, among thy peoples; Out of Machir came down governors, And out of Zebulun they that handle the marshal's staff."
7,5,15,"And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; As was Issachar, so was Barak; Into the valley they rushed forth at his feet. By the watercourses of Reuben There were great resolves of heart."
7,5,16,"Why sattest thou among the sheepfolds, To hear the pipings for the flocks? At the watercourses of Reuben There were great searchings of heart."
7,5,17,"Gilead abode beyond the Jordan: And Dan, why did he remain in ships? Asher sat still at the haven of the sea, And abode by his creeks."
7,5,18,"Zebulun was a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death, And Naphtali, upon the high places of the field."
7,5,19,"The kings came and fought; Then fought the kings of Canaan. In Taanach by the waters of Megiddo: They took no gain of money."
7,5,20,"From heaven fought the stars, From their courses they fought against Sisera."
7,5,21,"The river Kishon swept them away, That ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, march on with strength."
7,5,22,"Then did the horsehoofs stamp By reason of the prancings, the prancings of their strong ones."
7,5,23,"Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of Jehovah. Curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof, Because they came not to the help of Jehovah, To the help of Jehovah against the mighty."
7,5,24,"Blessed above women shall Jael be, The wife of Heber the Kenite; Blessed shall she be above women in the tent."
7,5,25,"He asked water, `and' she gave him milk; She brought him butter in a lordly dish."
7,5,26,"She put her hand to the tent-pin, And her right hand to the workmen's hammer; And with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote through his head; Yea, she pierced and struck through his temples."
7,5,27,"At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay; At her feet he bowed, he fell; Where he bowed, there he fell down dead."
7,5,28,"Through the window she looked forth, and cried, The mother of Sisera `cried' through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why tarry the wheels of his chariots?"
7,5,29,"Her wise ladies answered her, Yea, she returned answer to herself,"
7,5,30,"Have they not found, have they not divided the spoil? A damsel, two damsels to every man; To Sisera a spoil of dyed garments, A spoil of dyed garments embroidered, Of dyed garments embroidered on both sides, on the necks of the spoil?"
7,5,31,"So let all thine enemies perish, O Jehovah: But let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years."
7,6,1,"And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years."
7,6,2,"And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel; and because of Midian the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds."
7,6,3,"And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east; they came up against them;"
7,6,4,"and they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance in Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass."
7,6,5,"For they came up with their cattle and their tents; they came in as locusts for multitude; both they and their camels were without number: and they came into the land to destroy it."
7,6,6,"And Israel was brought very low because of Midian; and the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah."
7,6,7,"And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah because of Midian,"
7,6,8,"that Jehovah sent a prophet unto the children of Israel: and he said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;"
7,6,9,"and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land;"
7,6,10,"and I said unto you, I am Jehovah your God; ye shall not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell. But ye have not hearkened unto my voice."
7,6,11,"And the angel of Jehovah came, and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites."
7,6,12,"And the angel of Jehovah appeared unto him, and said unto him, Jehovah is with thee, thou mighty man of valor."
7,6,13,"And Gideon said unto him, Oh, my lord, if Jehovah is with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where are all his wondrous works which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not Jehovah bring us up from Egypt? but now Jehovah hath cast us off, and delivered us into the hand of Midian."
7,6,14,"And Jehovah looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and save Israel from the hand of Midian: have not I sent thee?"
7,6,15,"And he said unto him, Oh, Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house."
7,6,16,"And Jehovah said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man."
7,6,17,"And he said unto him, If now I have found favor in thy sight, then show me a sign that it is thou that talkest with me."
7,6,18,"Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and lay it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again."
7,6,19,"And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it."
7,6,20,"And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so."
7,6,21,"Then the angel of Jehovah put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there went up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of Jehovah departed out of his sight."
7,6,22,"And Gideon saw that he was the angel of Jehovah; and Gideon said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah! forasmuch as I have seen the angel of Jehovah face to face."
7,6,23,"And Jehovah said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die."
7,6,24,"Then Gideon built an altar there unto Jehovah, and called it Jehovah-shalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites."
7,6,25,"And it came to pass the same night, that Jehovah said unto him, Take thy father's bullock, even the second bullock seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the Asherah that is by it;"
7,6,26,"and build an altar unto Jehovah thy God upon the top of this stronghold, in the orderly manner, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt-offering with the wood of the Asherah which thou shalt cut down."
7,6,27,"Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as Jehovah had spoken unto him: and it came to pass, because he feared his father's household and the men of the city, so that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night."
7,6,28,"And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built."
7,6,29,"And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing."
7,6,30,"Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die, because he hath broken down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the Asherah that was by it."
7,6,31,"And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye contend for Baal? Or will ye save him? he that will contend for him, let him be put to death whilst `it is yet' morning: if he be a god, let him contend for himself, because one hath broken down his altar."
7,6,32,"Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal contend against him, because he hath broken down his altar."
7,6,33,"Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel."
7,6,34,"But the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Gideon; and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered together after him."
7,6,35,"And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; and they also were gathered together after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them."
7,6,36,"And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast spoken,"
7,6,37,"behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing-floor; if there be dew on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the ground, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast spoken."
7,6,38,"And it was so; for he rose up early on the morrow, and pressed the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of water."
7,6,39,"And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once: let me make trial, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew."
7,6,40,"And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground."
7,7,1,"Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and encamped beside the spring of Harod: and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley."
7,7,2,"And Jehovah said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me."
7,7,3,"Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and depart from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand."
7,7,4,"And Jehovah said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go."
7,7,5,"So he brought down the people unto the water: and Jehovah said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink."
7,7,6,"And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water."
7,7,7,"And Jehovah said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thy hand; and let all the people go every man unto his place."
7,7,8,"So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets; and he sent all the men of Israel every man unto his tent, but retained the three hundred men: and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley."
7,7,9,"And it came to pass the same night, that Jehovah said unto him, Arise, get thee down into the camp; for I have delivered it into thy hand."
7,7,10,"But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Purah thy servant down to the camp:"
7,7,11,"and thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thy hands be strengthened to go down into the camp. Then went he down with Purah his servant unto the outermost part of the armed men that were in the camp."
7,7,12,"And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is upon the sea-shore for multitude."
7,7,13,"And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man telling a dream unto his fellow; and he said, Behold, I dreamed a dream; and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came unto the tent, and smote it so that it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat."
7,7,14,"And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: into his hand God hath delivered Midian, and all the host."
7,7,15,"And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped; and he returned into the camp of Israel, and said, Arise; for Jehovah hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian."
7,7,16,"And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all of them trumpets, and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers."
7,7,17,"And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do."
7,7,18,"When I blow the trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, For Jehovah and for Gideon."
7,7,19,"So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands."
7,7,20,"And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands wherewith to blow; and they cried, The sword of Jehovah and of Gideon."
7,7,21,"And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran; and they shouted, and put `them' to flight."
7,7,22,"And they blew the three hundred trumpets, and Jehovah set every man's sword against his fellow, and against all the host; and the host fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath."
7,7,23,"And the men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian."
7,7,24,"And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill-country of Ephraim, saying, Come down against Midian, and take before them the waters, as far as Beth-barah, even the Jordan. So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and took the waters as far as Beth-barah, even the Jordan."
7,7,25,"And they took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian: and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan."
7,8,1,"And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with Midian? And they did chide with him sharply."
7,8,2,"And he said unto them, What have I now done in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?"
7,8,3,"God hath delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison with you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that."
7,8,4,"And Gideon came to the Jordan, `and' passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing."
7,8,5,"And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian."
7,8,6,"And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?"
7,8,7,"And Gideon said, Therefore when Jehovah hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers."
7,8,8,"And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them in like manner; and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered."
7,8,9,"And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower."
7,8,10,"Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the host of the children of the east; for there fell a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword."
7,8,11,"And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was secure."
7,8,12,"And Zebah and Zalmunna fled; and he pursued after them; and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host."
7,8,13,"And Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres."
7,8,14,"And he caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he described for him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, seventy and seven men."
7,8,15,"And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom ye did taunt me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary?"
7,8,16,"And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth."
7,8,17,"And he brake down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city."
7,8,18,"Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king."
7,8,19,"And he said, They were my brethren, the sons of my mother: as Jehovah liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you."
7,8,20,"And he said unto Jether his first-born, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword; for he feared, because he was yet a youth."
7,8,21,"Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us; for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that were on their camels' necks."
7,8,22,"Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also; for thou hast saved us out of the hand of Midian."
7,8,23,"And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: Jehovah shall rule over you."
7,8,24,"And Gideon said unto them, I would make a request of you, that ye would give me every man the ear-rings of his spoil. (For they had golden ear-rings, because they were Ishmaelites.)"
7,8,25,"And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the ear-rings of his spoil."
7,8,26,"And the weight of the golden ear-rings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred `shekels' of gold, besides the crescents, and the pendants, and the purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were about their camels' necks."
7,8,27,"And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel played the harlot after it there; and it became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house."
7,8,28,"So Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon."
7,8,29,"And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house."
7,8,30,"And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten; for he had many wives."
7,8,31,"And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, and he called his name Abimelech."
7,8,32,"And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites."
7,8,33,"And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and played the harlot after the Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god."
7,8,34,"And the children of Israel remembered not Jehovah their God, who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side;"
7,8,35,"neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, `who is' Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had showed unto Israel."
7,9,1,"And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren, and spake with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,"
7,9,2,"Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, that all the sons of Jerubbaal, who are threescore and ten persons, rule over you, or that one rule over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh."
7,9,3,"And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother."
7,9,4,"And they gave him threescore and ten `pieces' of silver out of the house of Baal-berith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light fellows, who followed him."
7,9,5,"And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself."
7,9,6,"And all the men of Shechem assembled themselves together, and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem."
7,9,7,"And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood on the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you."
7,9,8,"The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive-tree, Reign thou over us."
7,9,9,"But the olive-tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honor God and man, and go to wave to and fro over the trees?"
7,9,10,"And the trees said to the fig-tree, Come thou, and reign over us."
7,9,11,"But the fig-tree said unto them, Should I leave my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to wave to and fro over the trees?"
7,9,12,"And the trees said unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us."
7,9,13,"And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my new wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to wave to and fro over the trees?"
7,9,14,"Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us."
7,9,15,"And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade; and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon."
7,9,16,"Now therefore, if ye have dealt truly and uprightly, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands;"
7,9,17,"(for my father fought for you, and adventured his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:"
7,9,18,"and ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maid-servant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother);"
7,9,19,"if ye then have dealt truly and uprightly with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:"
7,9,20,"but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech."
7,9,21,"And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother."
7,9,22,"And Abimelech was prince over Israel three years."
7,9,23,"And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:"
7,9,24,"that the violence done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and that their blood might be laid upon Abimelech their brother, who slew them, and upon the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to slay his brethren."
7,9,25,"And the men of Shechem set liers-in-wait for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech."
7,9,26,"And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him."
7,9,27,"And they went out into the field, and gathered their vineyards, and trod `the grapes', and held festival, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech."
7,9,28,"And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve ye the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: but why should we serve him?"
7,9,29,"And would that this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out."
7,9,30,"And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled."
7,9,31,"And he sent messengers unto Abimelech craftily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren are come to Shechem; and, behold, they constrain the city `to take part' against thee."
7,9,32,"Now therefore, up by night, thou and the people that are with thee, and lie in wait in the field:"
7,9,33,"and it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and rush upon the city; and, behold, when he and the people that are with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion."
7,9,34,"And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies."
7,9,35,"And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from the ambushment."
7,9,36,"And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the tops of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men."
7,9,37,"And Gaal spake again and said, See, there come people down by the middle of the land, and one company cometh by the way of the oak of Meonenim."
7,9,38,"Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, that thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that thou hast despised? go out now, I pray, and fight with them."
7,9,39,"And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech."
7,9,40,"And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and there fell many wounded, even unto the entrance of the gate."
7,9,41,"And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem."
7,9,42,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech."
7,9,43,"And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field; and he looked, and, behold, the people came forth out of the city; And he rose up against them, and smote them."
7,9,44,"And Abimelech, and the companies that were with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and the two companies rushed upon all that were in the field, and smote them."
7,9,45,"And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that were therein: and he beat down the city, and sowed it with salt."
7,9,46,"And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard thereof, they entered into the stronghold of the house of Elberith."
7,9,47,"And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together."
7,9,48,"And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on his shoulder: and he said unto the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done."
7,9,49,"And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women."
7,9,50,"Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it."
7,9,51,"But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut themselves in, and gat them up to the roof of the tower."
7,9,52,"And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and drew near unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire."
7,9,53,"And a certain woman cast an upper millstone upon Abimelech's head, and brake his skull."
7,9,54,"Then he called hastily unto the young man his armorbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and kill me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died."
7,9,55,"And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place."
7,9,56,"Thus God requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren;"
7,9,57,"and all the wickedness of the men of Shechem did God requite upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal."
7,10,1,"And after Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in the hill-country of Ephraim."
7,10,2,"And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir."
7,10,3,"And after him arose Jair, the Gileadite; and he judged Israel twenty and two years."
7,10,4,"And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havvoth-jair unto this day, which are in the land of Gilead."
7,10,5,"And Jair died, and was buried in Kamon."
7,10,6,"And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and served the Baalim, and the Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Sidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines; and they forsook Jehovah, and served him not."
7,10,7,"And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the children of Ammon."
7,10,8,"And they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel that year: eighteen years `oppressed they' all the children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead."
7,10,9,"And the children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed."
7,10,10,"And the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah, saying, We have sinned against thee, even because we have forsaken our God, and have served the Baalim."
7,10,11,"And Jehovah said unto the children of Israel, `Did' not `I save you' from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?"
7,10,12,"The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried unto me, and I saved you out of their hand."
7,10,13,"Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will save you no more."
7,10,14,"Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them save you in the time of your distress."
7,10,15,"And the children of Israel said unto Jehovah, We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; only deliver us, we pray thee, this day."
7,10,16,"And they put away the foreign gods from among them, and served Jehovah; and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel."
7,10,17,"Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpah."
7,10,18,"And the people, the princes of Gilead, said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
7,11,1,"Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of a harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah."
7,11,2,"And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and when his wife's sons grew up, they drove out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house; for thou art the son of another woman."
7,11,3,"Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah, and they went out with him."
7,11,4,"And it came to pass after a while, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel."
7,11,5,"And it was so, that, when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob;"
7,11,6,"and they said unto Jephthah, Come and be our chief, that we may fight with the children of Ammon."
7,11,7,"And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and drive me out of my father's house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?"
7,11,8,"And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore are we turned again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight with the children of Ammon; and thou shalt be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
7,11,9,"And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight with the children of Ammon, and Jehovah deliver them before me, shall I be your head?"
7,11,10,"And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Jehovah shall be witness between us; surely according to thy word so will we do."
7,11,11,"Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them: and Jephthah spake all his words before Jehovah in Mizpah."
7,11,12,"And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come unto me to fight against my land?"
7,11,13,"And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when he came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon even unto the Jabbok, and unto the Jordan: now therefore restore those `lands' again peaceably."
7,11,14,"And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon;"
7,11,15,"and he said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah: Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon,"
7,11,16,"but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness unto the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh;"
7,11,17,"then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land; but the king of Edom hearkened not. And in like manner he sent unto the king of Moab; but he would not: and Israel abode in Kadesh."
7,11,18,"Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side of the Arnon; but they came not within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab."
7,11,19,"And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land unto my place."
7,11,20,"But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel."
7,11,21,"And Jehovah, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country."
7,11,22,"And they possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even unto the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto the Jordan."
7,11,23,"So now Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess them?"
7,11,24,"Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever Jehovah our God hath dispossessed from before us, them will we possess."
7,11,25,"And now art thou anything better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them?"
7,11,26,"While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon, three hundred years; wherefore did ye not recover them within that time?"
7,11,27,"I therefore have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: Jehovah, the Judge, be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon."
7,11,28,"Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him."
7,11,29,"Then the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon."
7,11,30,"And Jephthah vowed a vow unto Jehovah, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,"
7,11,31,"then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth from the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be Jehovah's, and I will offer it up for a burnt-offering."
7,11,32,"So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and Jehovah delivered them into his hand."
7,11,33,"And he smote them from Aroer until thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel."
7,11,34,"And Jephthah came to Mizpah unto his house; and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; besides her he had neither son nor daughter."
7,11,35,"And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me; for I have opened my mouth unto Jehovah, and I cannot go back."
7,11,36,"And she said unto him, My father, thou hast opened thy mouth unto Jehovah; do unto me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth, forasmuch as Jehovah hath taken vengeance for thee on thine enemies, even on the children of Ammon."
7,11,37,"And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may depart and go down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions."
7,11,38,"And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she departed, she and her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains."
7,11,39,"And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew not man. And it was a custom in Israel,"
7,11,40,"that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year."
7,12,1,"And the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and passed northward; and they said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thy house upon thee with fire."
7,12,2,"And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye saved me not out of their hand."
7,12,3,"And when I saw that ye saved me not, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and Jehovah delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?"
7,12,4,"Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye are fugitives of Ephraim, ye Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim, `and' in the midst of Manasseh."
7,12,5,"And the Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. And it was so, that, when `any of' the fugitives of Ephraim said, Let me go over, the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;"
7,12,6,"then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth; and he said Sibboleth; for he could not frame to pronounce it right: then they laid hold on him, and slew him at the fords of the Jordan. And there fell at that time of Ephraim forty and two thousand."
7,12,7,"And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in `one of' the cities of Gilead."
7,12,8,"And after him Ibzan of Beth-lehem judged Israel."
7,12,9,"And he had thirty sons; and thirty daughters he sent abroad, and thirty daughters he brought in from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years."
7,12,10,"And Ibzan died, and was buried at Beth-lehem."
7,12,11,"And after him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years."
7,12,12,"And Elon the Zebulunite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun."
7,12,13,"And after him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel."
7,12,14,"And he had forty sons and thirty sons' sons, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years."
7,12,15,"And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill-country of the Amalekites."
7,13,1,"And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah; and Jehovah delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years."
7,13,2,"And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not."
7,13,3,"And the angel of Jehovah appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not; but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son."
7,13,4,"Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:"
7,13,5,"for, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come upon his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines."
7,13,6,"Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of the angel of God, very terrible; and I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:"
7,13,7,"but he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb to the day of his death."
7,13,8,"Then Manoah entreated Jehovah, and said, Oh, Lord, I pray thee, let the man of God whom thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born."
7,13,9,"And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her."
7,13,10,"And the woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the `other' day."
7,13,11,"And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am."
7,13,12,"And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass: what shall be the ordering of the child, and `how' shall we do unto him?"
7,13,13,"And the angel of Jehovah said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware."
7,13,14,"She may not eat of anything that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe."
7,13,15,"And Manoah said unto the angel of Jehovah, I pray thee, let us detain thee, that we may make ready a kid for thee."
7,13,16,"And the angel of Jehovah said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; and if thou wilt make ready a burnt-offering, thou must offer it unto Jehovah. For Manoah knew not that he was the angel of Jehovah."
7,13,17,"And Manoah said unto the angel of Jehovah, What is thy name, that, when thy words come to pass, we may do thee honor?"
7,13,18,"And the angel of Jehovah said unto him, Wherefore askest thou after my name, seeing it is wonderful?"
7,13,19,"So Manoah took the kid with the meal-offering, and offered it upon the rock unto Jehovah: and `the angel' did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on."
7,13,20,"For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of Jehovah ascended in the flame of the altar: and Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground."
7,13,21,"But the angel of Jehovah did no more appear to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of Jehovah."
7,13,22,"And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God."
7,13,23,"But his wife said unto him, If Jehovah were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and a meal-offering at our hand, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things as these."
7,13,24,"And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and Jehovah blessed him."
7,13,25,"And the Spirit of Jehovah began to move him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol."
7,14,1,"And Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines."
7,14,2,"And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife."
7,14,3,"Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well."
7,14,4,"But his father and his mother knew not that it was of Jehovah; for he sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines had rule over Israel."
7,14,5,"Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah: and, behold, a young lion roared against him."
7,14,6,"And the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid; and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done."
7,14,7,"And he went down, and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well."
7,14,8,"And after a while he returned to take her; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey."
7,14,9,"And he took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went; and he came to his father and mother, and gave unto them, and they did eat: but he told them not that he had taken the honey out of the body of the lion."
7,14,10,"And his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do."
7,14,11,"And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him."
7,14,12,"And Samson said unto them, Let me now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can declare it unto me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment;"
7,14,13,"but if ye cannot declare it unto me, then shall ye give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it."
7,14,14,"And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth food, And out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days declare the riddle."
7,14,15,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to impoverish us? is it not `so'?"
7,14,16,"And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell thee?"
7,14,17,"And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she pressed him sore; and she told the riddle to the children of her people."
7,14,18,"And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, Ye had not found out my riddle."
7,14,19,"And the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and smote thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave the changes `of raiment' unto them that declared the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house."
7,14,20,"But Samson's wife was `given' to his companion, whom he had used as his friend."
7,15,1,"But it came to pass after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in."
7,15,2,"And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her."
7,15,3,"And Samson said unto them, This time shall I be blameless in regard of the Philistines, when I do them a mischief."
7,15,4,"And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between every two tails."
7,15,5,"And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and the standing grain, and also the oliveyards."
7,15,6,"Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they said, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he hath taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire."
7,15,7,"And Samson said unto them, If ye do after this manner, surely I will be avenged of you, and after that I will cease."
7,15,8,"And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of Etam."
7,15,9,"Then the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi."
7,15,10,"And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they said, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us."
7,15,11,"Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what then is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them."
7,15,12,"And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves."
7,15,13,"And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock."
7,15,14,"When he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him: and the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon him, and the ropes that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands dropped from off his hands."
7,15,15,"And he found a fresh jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and smote a thousand men therewith."
7,15,16,"And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, With the jawbone of an ass have I smitten a thousand men."
7,15,17,"And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand; and that place was called Ramath-lehi."
7,15,18,"And he was sore athirst, and called on Jehovah, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance by the hand of thy servant; and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised."
7,15,19,"But God clave the hollow place that is in Lehi, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore the name thereof was called En-hakkore, which is in Lehi, unto this day."
7,15,20,"And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years."
7,16,1,"And Samson went to Gaza, and saw there a harlot, and went in unto her."
7,16,2,"`And it was told' the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, `Let be' till morning light, then we will kill him."
7,16,3,"And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and laid hold of the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before Hebron."
7,16,4,"And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah."
7,16,5,"And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred `pieces' of silver."
7,16,6,"And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee."
7,16,7,"And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withes that were never dried, then shall I become weak, and be as another man."
7,16,8,"Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withes which had not been dried, and she bound him with them."
7,16,9,"Now she had liers-in-wait abiding in the inner chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withes, as a string of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known."
7,16,10,"And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound."
7,16,11,"And he said unto her, If they only bind me with new ropes wherewith no work hath been done, then shall I become weak, and be as another man."
7,16,12,"So Delilah took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And the liers-in-wait were abiding in the inner chamber. And he brake them off his arms like a thread."
7,16,13,"And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web."
7,16,14,"And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and plucked away the pin of the beam, and the web."
7,16,15,"And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thy heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth."
7,16,16,"And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, that his soul was vexed unto death."
7,16,17,"And he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon my head; for I have been a Nazirite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man."
7,16,18,"And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath told me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought the money in their hand."
7,16,19,"And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and shaved off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him."
7,16,20,"And she said, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times, and shake myself free. But he knew not that Jehovah was departed from him."
7,16,21,"And the Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison-house."
7,16,22,"Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven."
7,16,23,"And the lords of the Philistines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice; for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand."
7,16,24,"And when the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hand our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, who hath slain many of us."
7,16,25,"And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison-house; and he made sport before them. And they set him between the pillars:"
7,16,26,"and Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house resteth, that I may lean upon them."
7,16,27,"Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport."
7,16,28,"And Samson called unto Jehovah, and said, O Lord Jehovah, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes."
7,16,29,"And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house rested, and leaned upon them, the one with his right hand, and the other with his left."
7,16,30,"And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead that he slew at his death were more than they that he slew in his life."
7,16,31,"Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burying-place of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years."
7,17,1,"And there was a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah."
7,17,2,"And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred `pieces' of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou didst utter a curse, and didst also speak it in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be my son of Jehovah."
7,17,3,"And he restored the eleven hundred `pieces' of silver to his mother; and his mother said, I verily dedicate the silver unto Jehovah from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee."
7,17,4,"And when he restored the money unto his mother, his mother took two hundred `pieces' of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and it was in the house of Micah."
7,17,5,"And the man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest."
7,17,6,"In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes."
7,17,7,"And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem-judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he sojourned there."
7,17,8,"And the man departed out of the city, out of Beth-lehem-judah, to sojourn where he could find `a place', and he came to the hill-country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed."
7,17,9,"And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Beth-lehem-judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find `a place'."
7,17,10,"And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten `pieces' of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in."
7,17,11,"And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons."
7,17,12,"And Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah."
7,17,13,"Then said Micah, Now know I that Jehovah will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest."
7,18,1,"In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day `their' inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel."
7,18,2,"And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their whole number, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land. And they came to the hill-country of Ephraim, unto the house of Micah, and lodged there."
7,18,3,"When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; and they turned aside thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what doest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?"
7,18,4,"And he said unto them, Thus and thus hath Micah dealt with me, and he hath hired me, and I am become his priest."
7,18,5,"And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous."
7,18,6,"And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before Jehovah is your way wherein ye go."
7,18,7,"Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt in security, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for there was none in the land, possessing authority, that might put `them' to shame in anything, and they were far from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with any man."
7,18,8,"And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What `say' ye?"
7,18,9,"And they said, Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land."
7,18,10,"When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and the land is large; for God hath given it into your hand, a place where there is no want of anything that is in the earth."
7,18,11,"And there set forth from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men girt with weapons of war."
7,18,12,"And they went up, and encamped in Kiriath-jearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan, unto this day; behold, it is behind Kiriath-jearim."
7,18,13,"And they passed thence unto the hill-country of Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah."
7,18,14,"Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do."
7,18,15,"And they turned aside thither, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and asked him of his welfare."
7,18,16,"And the six hundred men girt with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate."
7,18,17,"And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men girt with weapons of war."
7,18,18,"And when these went into Micah's house, and fetched the graven image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said unto them, What do ye?"
7,18,19,"And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be priest unto the house of one man, or to be priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?"
7,18,20,"And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people."
7,18,21,"So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the goods before them."
7,18,22,"When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan."
7,18,23,"And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?"
7,18,24,"And he said, ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and are gone away, and what have I more? and how then say ye unto me, What aileth thee?"
7,18,25,"And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household."
7,18,26,"And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house."
7,18,27,"And they took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people quiet and secure, and smote them with the edge of the sword; and they burnt the city with fire."
7,18,28,"And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Beth-rehob. And they built the city, and dwelt therein."
7,18,29,"And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first."
7,18,30,"And the children of Dan set up for themselves the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land."
7,18,31,"So they set them up Micah's graven image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh."
7,19,1,"And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Beth-lehem-judah."
7,19,2,"And his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Beth-lehem-judah, and was there the space of four months."
7,19,3,"And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly unto her, to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's house; and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him."
7,19,4,"And his father-in-law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there."
7,19,5,"And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said unto his son-in-law, Strengthen thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward ye shall go your way."
7,19,6,"So they sat down, and did eat and drink, both of them together: and the damsel's father said unto the man, Be pleased, I pray thee, to tarry all night, and let thy heart be merry."
7,19,7,"And the man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him, and he lodged there again."
7,19,8,"And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel's father said, Strengthen thy heart, I pray thee, and tarry ye until the day declineth; and they did eat, both of them."
7,19,9,"And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thy heart may be merry; and to-morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home."
7,19,10,"But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus (the same is Jerusalem): and there were with him a couple of asses saddled; his concubine also was with him."
7,19,11,"When they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it."
7,19,12,"And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside into the city of a foreigner, that is not of the children of Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah."
7,19,13,"And he said unto his servant, Come and let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah."
7,19,14,"So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them near to Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin."
7,19,15,"And they turned aside thither, to go in to lodge in Gibeah: and he went in, and sat him down in the street of the city; for there was no man that took them into his house to lodge."
7,19,16,"And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even: now the man was of the hill-country of Ephraim, and he sojourned in Gibeah; but the men of the place were Benjamites."
7,19,17,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city; and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?"
7,19,18,"And he said unto him, We are passing from Beth-lehem-judah unto the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim; from thence am I, and I went to Beth-lehem-judah: and I am `now' going to the house of Jehovah; and there is no man that taketh me into his house."
7,19,19,"Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man that is with thy servants: there is no want of anything."
7,19,20,"And the old man said, Peace be unto thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street."
7,19,21,"So he brought him into his house, and gave the asses fodder; and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink."
7,19,22,"As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain base fellows, beset the house round about, beating at the door; and they spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thy house, that we may know him."
7,19,23,"And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this folly."
7,19,24,"Behold, here is my daughter a virgin, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not any such folly."
7,19,25,"But the men would not hearken to him: so the man laid hold on his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go."
7,19,26,"Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light."
7,19,27,"And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands upon the threshold."
7,19,28,"And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going; but none answered: then he took her up upon the ass; and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place."
7,19,29,"And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel."
7,19,30,"And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider it, take counsel, and speak."
7,20,1,"Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, with the land of Gilead, unto Jehovah at Mizpah."
7,20,2,"And the chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword."
7,20,3,"(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpah.) And the children of Israel said, Tell us, how was this wickedness brought to pass?"
7,20,4,"And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was murdered, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge."
7,20,5,"And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about me by night; me they thought to have slain, and my concubine they forced, and she is dead."
7,20,6,"And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel; for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel."
7,20,7,"Behold, ye children of Israel, all of you, give here your advice and counsel."
7,20,8,"And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn unto his house."
7,20,9,"But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: `we will go up' against it by lot;"
7,20,10,"and we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victuals for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel."
7,20,11,"So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man."
7,20,12,"And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is come to pass among you?"
7,20,13,"Now therefore deliver up the men, the base fellows, that are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel."
7,20,14,"And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel."
7,20,15,"And the children of Benjamin were numbered on that day out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men."
7,20,16,"Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at a hair-breadth, and not miss."
7,20,17,"And the men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war."
7,20,18,"And the children of Israel arose, and went up to Beth-el, and asked counsel of God; and they said, Who shall go up for us first to battle against the children of Benjamin? And Jehovah said, Judah `shall go up' first."
7,20,19,"And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah."
7,20,20,"And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah."
7,20,21,"And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that day twenty and two thousand men."
7,20,22,"And the people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves, and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day."
7,20,23,"And the children of Israel went up and wept before Jehovah until even; and they asked of Jehovah, saying, Shall I again draw nigh to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And Jehovah said, Go up against him."
7,20,24,"And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day."
7,20,25,"And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword."
7,20,26,"Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto Beth-el, and wept, and sat there before Jehovah, and fasted that day until even; and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Jehovah."
7,20,27,"And the children of Israel asked of Jehovah (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,"
7,20,28,"and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And Jehovah said, Go up; for to-morrow I will deliver him into thy hand."
7,20,29,"And Israel set liers-in-wait against Gibeah round about."
7,20,30,"And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times."
7,20,31,"And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite and kill of the people, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to Beth-el, and the other to Gibeah, in the field, about thirty men of Israel."
7,20,32,"And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them away from the city unto the highways."
7,20,33,"And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Baal-tamar: and the liers-in-wait of Israel brake forth out of their place, even out of Maareh-geba."
7,20,34,"And there came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore; but they knew not that evil was close upon them."
7,20,35,"And Jehovah smote Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty and five thousand and a hundred men: all these drew the sword."
7,20,36,"So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten; for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin, because they trusted unto the liers-in-wait whom they had set against Gibeah."
7,20,37,"And the liers-in-wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers-in-wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword."
7,20,38,"Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers-in-wait was, that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city."
7,20,39,"And the men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons; for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle."
7,20,40,"But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them; and, behold, the whole of the city went up `in smoke' to heaven."
7,20,41,"And the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed; for they saw that evil was come upon them."
7,20,42,"Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle followed hard after them; and they that came out of the cities destroyed them in the midst thereof."
7,20,43,"They inclosed the Benjamites round about, `and' chased them, `and' trod them down at `their' resting-place, as far as over against Gibeah toward the sunrising."
7,20,44,"And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these `were' men of valor."
7,20,45,"And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men, and followed hard after them unto Gidom, and smote of them two thousand men."
7,20,46,"So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these `were' men of valor."
7,20,47,"But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon, and abode in the rock of Rimmon four months."
7,20,48,"And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city, and the cattle, and all that they found: moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire."
7,21,1,"Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife."
7,21,2,"And the people came to Beth-el, and sat there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore."
7,21,3,"And they said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to-day one tribe lacking in Israel?"
7,21,4,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings."
7,21,5,"And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up in the assembly unto Jehovah? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up unto Jehovah to Mizpah, saying, He shall surely be put to death."
7,21,6,"And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day."
7,21,7,"How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by Jehovah that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?"
7,21,8,"And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up unto Jehovah to Mizpah? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly."
7,21,9,"For when the people were numbered, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there."
7,21,10,"And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones."
7,21,11,"And this is the thing that ye shall do: ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man."
7,21,12,"And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins, that had not known man by lying with him; and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan."
7,21,13,"And the whole congregation sent and spake to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace unto them."
7,21,14,"And Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead: and yet so they sufficed them not."
7,21,15,"And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that Jehovah had made a breach in the tribes of Israel."
7,21,16,"Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?"
7,21,17,"And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that are escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not blotted out from Israel."
7,21,18,"Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters, for the children of Israel had sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin."
7,21,19,"And they said, Behold, there is a feast of Jehovah from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah."
7,21,20,"And they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,"
7,21,21,"and see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin."
7,21,22,"And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come to complain unto us, that we will say unto them, Grant them graciously unto us, because we took not for each man `of them' his wife in battle, neither did ye give them unto them, else would ye now be guilty."
7,21,23,"And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they carried off: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and built the cities, and dwelt in them."
7,21,24,"And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance."
7,21,25,"In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes."
8,1,1,"And it came to pass in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem-judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons."
8,1,2,"And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there."
8,1,3,"And Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons."
8,1,4,"And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelt there about ten years."
8,1,5,"And Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband."
8,1,6,"Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that Jehovah had visited his people in giving them bread."
8,1,7,"And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah."
8,1,8,"And Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each of you to her mother's house: Jehovah deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me."
8,1,9,"Jehovah grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voice, and wept."
8,1,10,"And they said unto her, Nay, but we will return with thee unto thy people."
8,1,11,"And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?"
8,1,12,"Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should even have a husband to-night, and should also bear sons;"
8,1,13,"would ye therefore tarry till they were grown? would ye therefore stay from having husbands? nay, my daughters, for it grieveth me much for your sakes, for the hand of Jehovah is gone forth against me."
8,1,14,"And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clave unto her."
8,1,15,"And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people, and unto her god: return thou after thy sister-in-law."
8,1,16,"And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, and to return from following after thee, for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God;"
8,1,17,"where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: Jehovah do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me."
8,1,18,"And when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking unto her."
8,1,19,"So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and `the women' said, Is this Naomi?"
8,1,20,"And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara; for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me."
8,1,21,"I went out full, and Jehovah hath brought me home again empty; why call ye me Naomi, seeing Jehovah hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?"
8,1,22,"So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest."
8,2,1,"And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz."
8,2,2,"And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter."
8,2,3,"And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on the portion of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech."
8,2,4,"And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, Jehovah be with you. And they answered him, Jehovah bless thee."
8,2,5,"Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?"
8,2,6,"And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:"
8,2,7,"And she said, Let me glean, I pray you, and gather after the reapers among the sheaves. So she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, save that she tarried a little in the house."
8,2,8,"Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither pass from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens."
8,2,9,"Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn."
8,2,10,"Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found favor in thy sight, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a foreigner?"
8,2,11,"And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been showed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband; and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people that thou knewest not heretofore."
8,2,12,"Jehovah recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of Jehovah, the God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to take refuge."
8,2,13,"Then she said, Let me find favor in thy sight, my lord, for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken kindly unto thy handmaid, though I be not as one of thy handmaidens."
8,2,14,"And at meal-time Boaz said unto her, Come hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers, and they reached her parched grain, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left thereof."
8,2,15,"And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not."
8,2,16,"And also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and rebuke her not."
8,2,17,"So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley."
8,2,18,"And she took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed."
8,2,19,"And her mother-in-law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to-day? and where hast thou wrought? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to-day is Boaz."
8,2,20,"And Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Jehovah, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is nigh of kin unto us, one of our near kinsmen."
8,2,21,"And Ruth the Moabitess said, Yea, he said unto me, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest."
8,2,22,"And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, and that they meet thee not in any other field."
8,2,23,"So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz, to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law."
8,3,1,"And Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?"
8,3,2,"And now is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to-night in the threshing-floor."
8,3,3,"Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the threshing-floor, but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking."
8,3,4,"And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do."
8,3,5,"And she said unto her, All that thou sayest I will do."
8,3,6,"And she went down unto the threshing-floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her."
8,3,7,"And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down."
8,3,8,"And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself; and, behold, a woman lay at his feet."
8,3,9,"And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thy handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thy handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman."
8,3,10,"And he said, Blessed be thou of Jehovah, my daughter: thou hast showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich."
8,3,11,"And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou sayest; for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a worthy woman."
8,3,12,"And now it is true that I am a near kinsman; howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I."
8,3,13,"Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as Jehovah liveth: lie down until the morning."
8,3,14,"And she lay at his feet until the morning. And she rose up before one could discern another. For he said, Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing-floor."
8,3,15,"And he said, Bring the mantle that is upon thee, and hold it; and she held it; and he measured six `measures' of barley, and laid it on her: and he went into the city."
8,3,16,"And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her."
8,3,17,"And she said, These six `measures' of barley gave he me; for he said, Go not empty unto thy mother-in-law."
8,3,18,"Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall; for the man will not rest, until he have finished the thing this day."
8,4,1,"Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down."
8,4,2,"And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down."
8,4,3,"And he said unto the near kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's:"
8,4,4,"And I thought to disclose it unto thee, saying, Buy it before them that sit here, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem it besides thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it."
8,4,5,"Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance."
8,4,6,"And the near kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: take thou my right of redemption on thee; for I cannot redeem it."
8,4,7,"Now this was `the custom' in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was the `manner of' attestation in Israel."
8,4,8,"So the near kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thyself. And he drew off his shoe."
8,4,9,"And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi."
8,4,10,"Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day."
8,4,11,"And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. Jehovah make the woman that is come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem:"
8,4,12,"and let thy house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which Jehovah shall give thee of this young woman."
8,4,13,"So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in unto her, and Jehovah gave her conception, and she bare a son."
8,4,14,"And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be Jehovah, who hath not left thee this day without a near kinsman; and let his name be famous in Israel."
8,4,15,"And he shall be unto thee a restorer of life, and a nourisher of thine old age, for thy daughter-in-law, who loveth thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him."
8,4,16,"And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it."
8,4,17,"And the women her neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David."
8,4,18,"Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez begat Hezron,"
8,4,19,"and Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,"
8,4,20,"and Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,"
8,4,21,"and Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,"
8,4,22,"and Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David."
9,1,1,"Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite:"
9,1,2,"and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children."
9,1,3,"And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice unto Jehovah of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests unto Jehovah, were there."
9,1,4,"And when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:"
9,1,5,"but unto Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but Jehovah had shut up her womb."
9,1,6,"And her rival provoked her sore, to make her fret, because Jehovah had shut up her womb."
9,1,7,"And `as' he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of Jehovah, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat."
9,1,8,"And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?"
9,1,9,"So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting upon his seat by the door-post of the temple of Jehovah."
9,1,10,"And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto Jehovah, and wept sore."
9,1,11,"And she vowed a vow, and said, O Jehovah of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give unto thy handmaid a man-child, then I will give him unto Jehovah all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head."
9,1,12,"And it came to pass, as she continued praying before Jehovah, that Eli marked her mouth."
9,1,13,"Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken."
9,1,14,"And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee."
9,1,15,"And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Jehovah."
9,1,16,"Count not thy handmaid for a wicked woman; for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have I spoken hitherto."
9,1,17,"Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant thy petition that thou hast asked of him."
9,1,18,"And she said, Let thy handmaid find favor in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat; and her countenance was no more `sad'."
9,1,19,"And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before Jehovah, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Jehovah remembered her."
9,1,20,"And it came to pass, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived, and bare a son; and she called his name Samuel, `saying', Because I have asked him of Jehovah."
9,1,21,"And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto Jehovah the yearly sacrifice, and his vow."
9,1,22,"But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, `I will not go up' until the child be weaned; and then I will bring him, that he may appear before Jehovah, and there abide for ever."
9,1,23,"And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only Jehovah establish his word. So the woman tarried and gave her son suck, until she weaned him."
9,1,24,"And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of Jehovah in Shiloh: and the child was young."
9,1,25,"And they slew the bullock, and brought the child to Eli."
9,1,26,"And she said, Oh, my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto Jehovah."
9,1,27,"For this child I prayed; and Jehovah hath given me my petition which I asked of him:"
9,1,28,"therefore also I have granted him to Jehovah; as long as he liveth he is granted to Jehovah. And he worshipped Jehovah there."
9,2,1,"And Hannah prayed, and said: My heart exulteth in Jehovah; My horn is exalted in Jehovah; My mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; Because I rejoice in thy salvation."
9,2,2,"There is none holy as Jehovah; For there is none besides thee, Neither is there any rock like our God."
9,2,3,"Talk no more so exceeding proudly; Let not arrogancy come out of your mouth; For Jehovah is a God of knowledge, And by him actions are weighed."
9,2,4,"The bows of the mighty men are broken; And they that stumbled are girded with strength."
9,2,5,"They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; And they that were hungry have ceased `to hunger': Yea, the barren hath borne seven; And she that hath many children languisheth."
9,2,6,"Jehovah killeth, and maketh alive: He bringeth down to Sheol, and bringeth up."
9,2,7,"Jehovah maketh poor, and maketh rich: He bringeth low, he also lifteth up."
9,2,8,"He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, He lifteth up the needy from the dunghill, To make them sit with princes, And inherit the throne of glory: For the pillars of the earth are Jehovah's, And he hath set the world upon them."
9,2,9,"He will keep the feet of his holy ones; But the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness; For by strength shall no man prevail."
9,2,10,"They that strive with Jehovah shall be broken to pieces; Against them will he thunder in heaven: Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth; And he will give strength unto his king, And exalt the horn of his anointed."
9,2,11,"And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto Jehovah before Eli the priest."
9,2,12,"Now the sons of Eli were base men; they knew not Jehovah."
9,2,13,"And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand;"
9,2,14,"and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither."
9,2,15,"Yea, before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have boiled flesh of thee, but raw."
9,2,16,"And if the man said unto him, They will surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would say, Nay, but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force."
9,2,17,"And the sin of the young men was very great before Jehovah; for the men despised the offering of Jehovah."
9,2,18,"But Samuel ministered before Jehovah, being a child, girded with a linen ephod."
9,2,19,"Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice."
9,2,20,"And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Jehovah give thee seed of this woman for the petition which was asked of Jehovah. And they went unto their own home."
9,2,21,"And Jehovah visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before Jehovah."
9,2,22,"Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how that they lay with the women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting."
9,2,23,"And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people."
9,2,24,"Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make Jehovah's people to transgress."
9,2,25,"If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against Jehovah, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding, they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because Jehovah was minded to slay them."
9,2,26,"And the child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Jehovah, and also with men."
9,2,27,"And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Did I reveal myself unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt `in bondage' to Pharaoh's house?"
9,2,28,"and did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up unto mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?"
9,2,29,"Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in `my' habitation, and honorest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?"
9,2,30,"Therefore Jehovah, the God of Israel, saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now Jehovah saith, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed."
9,2,31,"Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house."
9,2,32,"And thou shalt behold the affliction of `my' habitation, in all the wealth which `God' shall give Israel; and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever."
9,2,33,"And the man of thine, `whom' I shall not cut off from mine altar, `shall be' to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thy heart; and all the increase of thy house shall die in the flower of their age."
9,2,34,"And this shall be the sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them."
9,2,35,"And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever."
9,2,36,"And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thy house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread."
9,3,1,"And the child Samuel ministered unto Jehovah before Eli. And the word of Jehovah was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision."
9,3,2,"And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to wax dim, so that he could not see),"
9,3,3,"and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down `to sleep', in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was;"
9,3,4,"that Jehovah called Samuel; and he said, Here am I."
9,3,5,"And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down."
9,3,6,"And Jehovah called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again."
9,3,7,"Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither was the word of Jehovah yet revealed unto him."
9,3,8,"And Jehovah called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah had called the child."
9,3,9,"Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Jehovah; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place."
9,3,10,"And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for thy servant heareth."
9,3,11,"And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle."
9,3,12,"In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even unto the end."
9,3,13,"For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse upon themselves, and he restrained them not."
9,3,14,"And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering for ever."
9,3,15,"And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision."
9,3,16,"Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I."
9,3,17,"And he said, What is the thing that `Jehovah' hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide anything from me of all the things that he spake unto thee."
9,3,18,"And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is Jehovah: let him do what seemeth him good."
9,3,19,"And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground."
9,3,20,"And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Jehovah."
9,3,21,"And Jehovah appeared again in Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Jehovah."
9,4,1,"And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines encamped in Aphek."
9,4,2,"And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines; and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men."
9,4,3,"And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath Jehovah smitten us to-day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of Shiloh unto us, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies."
9,4,4,"So the people sent to Shiloh; and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of hosts, who sitteth `above' the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God."
9,4,5,"And when the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again."
9,4,6,"And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of Jehovah was come into the camp."
9,4,7,"And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore."
9,4,8,"Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? these are the gods that smote the Egyptians with all manner of plagues in the wilderness."
9,4,9,"Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight."
9,4,10,"And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man to his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen."
9,4,11,"And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain."
9,4,12,"And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head."
9,4,13,"And when he came, lo, Eli was sitting upon his seat by the wayside watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out."
9,4,14,"And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man hasted, and came and told Eli."
9,4,15,"Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were set, so that he could not see."
9,4,16,"And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to-day out of the army. And he said, How went the matter, my son?"
9,4,17,"And he that brought the tidings answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken."
9,4,18,"And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that `Eli' feel from off his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years."
9,4,19,"And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and brought forth; for her pains came upon her."
9,4,20,"And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast brought forth a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it."
9,4,21,"And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel; because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband."
9,4,22,"And she said, The glory is departed from Israel; for the ark of God is taken."
9,5,1,"Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God, and they brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod."
9,5,2,"And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon."
9,5,3,"And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again."
9,5,4,"And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands `lay' cut off upon the threshold; only `the stump of' Dagon was left to him."
9,5,5,"Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, unto this day."
9,5,6,"But the hand of Jehovah was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with tumors, even Ashdod and the borders thereof."
9,5,7,"And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us; for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god."
9,5,8,"They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel `thither'."
9,5,9,"And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of Jehovah was against the city with a very great discomfiture: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great; and tumors brake out upon them."
9,5,10,"So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people."
9,5,11,"They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that is slay us not, and our people. For there was a deadly discomfiture throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there."
9,5,12,"And the men that died not were smitten with the tumors; and the cry of the city went up to heaven."
9,6,1,"And the ark of Jehovah was in the country of the Philistines seven months."
9,6,2,"And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do with the ark of Jehovah? show us wherewith we shall sent it to its place."
9,6,3,"And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but by all means return him a trespass-offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you."
9,6,4,"Then said they, What shall be the trespass-offering which we shall return to him? And they said, Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, `according to' the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all, and on your lords."
9,6,5,"Wherefore ye shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land."
9,6,6,"Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?"
9,6,7,"Now therefore take and prepare you a new cart, and two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke; and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them;"
9,6,8,"and take the ark of Jehovah, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass-offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go."
9,6,9,"And see; if it goeth up by the way of its own border to Beth-shemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us."
9,6,10,"And the men did so, and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home;"
9,6,11,"and they put the ark of Jehovah upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors."
9,6,12,"And the kine took the straight way by the way to Beth-shemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth-shemesh."
9,6,13,"And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it."
9,6,14,"And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered up the kine for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah."
9,6,15,"And the Levites took down the ark of Jehovah, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt-offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto Jehovah."
9,6,16,"And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day."
9,6,17,"And these are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass-offering unto Jehovah: for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;"
9,6,18,"and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of country villages, even unto the great stone, whereon they set down the ark of Jehovah, `which stone remaineth' unto this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite."
9,6,19,"And he smote of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of Jehovah, he smote of the people seventy men, `and' fifty thousand men; and the people mourned, because Jehovah had smitten the people with a great slaughter."
9,6,20,"And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before Jehovah, this holy God? and to whom shall he go up from us?"
9,6,21,"And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought back the ark of Jehovah; come ye down, and fetch it up to you."
9,7,1,"And the men of Kiriath-jearim came, and fetched up the ark of Jehovah, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of Jehovah."
9,7,2,"And it came to pass, from the day that the ark abode in Kiriath-jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after Jehovah."
9,7,3,"And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto Jehovah with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you, and direct your hearts unto Jehovah, and serve him only; and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines."
9,7,4,"Then the children of Israel did put away the Baalim and the Ashtaroth, and served Jehovah only."
9,7,5,"And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray for you unto Jehovah."
9,7,6,"And they gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before Jehovah, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against Jehovah. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpah."
9,7,7,"And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines."
9,7,8,"And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto Jehovah our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines."
9,7,9,"And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt-offering unto Jehovah: and Samuel cried unto Jehovah for Israel; and Jehovah answered him."
9,7,10,"And as Samuel was offering up the burnt-offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel; but Jehovah thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten down before Israel."
9,7,11,"And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Beth-car."
9,7,12,"Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, saying, Hitherto hath Jehovah helped us."
9,7,13,"So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more within the border of Israel: and the hand of Jehovah was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel."
9,7,14,"And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the border thereof did Israel deliver out of the hand of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites."
9,7,15,"And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life."
9,7,16,"And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth-el and Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all those places."
9,7,17,"And his return was to Ramah, for there was his house; and there he judged Israel: and he built there an altar unto Jehovah."
9,8,1,"And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel."
9,8,2,"Now the name of his first-born was Joel; and the name of his second, Abijah: they were judges in Beer-sheba."
9,8,3,"And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted justice."
9,8,4,"Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah;"
9,8,5,"and they said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations."
9,8,6,"But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto Jehovah."
9,8,7,"And Jehovah said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not be king over them."
9,8,8,"According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee."
9,8,9,"Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit thou shalt protest solemnly unto them, and shalt show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them."
9,8,10,"And Samuel told all the words of Jehovah unto the people that asked of him a king."
9,8,11,"And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them unto him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots;"
9,8,12,"and he will appoint them unto him for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties; and `he will set some' to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots."
9,8,13,"And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers."
9,8,14,"And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants."
9,8,15,"And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants."
9,8,16,"And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work."
9,8,17,"He will take the tenth of your flocks: and ye shall be his servants."
9,8,18,"And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king whom ye shall have chosen you; and Jehovah will not answer you in that day."
9,8,19,"But the people refused to hearken unto the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay: but we will have a king over us,"
9,8,20,"that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles."
9,8,21,"And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of Jehovah."
9,8,22,"And Jehovah said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city."
9,9,1,"Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valor."
9,9,2,"And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a young man and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people."
9,9,3,"And the asses of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses."
9,9,4,"And he passed through the hill-country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not."
9,9,5,"When they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return, lest my father leave off caring for the asses, and be anxious for us."
9,9,6,"And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man that is held in honor; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can tell us concerning our journey whereon we go."
9,9,7,"Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?"
9,9,8,"And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way."
9,9,9,"(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said, Come, and let us go to the seer; for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)"
9,9,10,"Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was."
9,9,11,"As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?"
9,9,12,"And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, `he is' before thee: make haste now, for he is come to-day into the city; for the people have a sacrifice to-day in the high place:"
9,9,13,"as soon as ye are come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he goeth up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; `and' afterwards they eat that are bidden. Now therefore get you up; for at this time ye shall find him."
9,9,14,"And they went up to the city; `and' as they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place."
9,9,15,"Now Jehovah had revealed unto Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,"
9,9,16,"To-morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be prince over my people Israel; and he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me."
9,9,17,"And when Samuel saw Saul, Jehovah said unto him, Behold, the man of whom I spake to thee! this same shall have authority over my people."
9,9,18,"Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is."
9,9,19,"And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer; go up before me unto the high place, for ye shall eat with me to-day: and in the morning I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thy heart."
9,9,20,"And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not they mind on them; for they are found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for thee, and for all thy father's house?"
9,9,21,"And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou to me after this manner?"
9,9,22,"And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest-chamber, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, who were about thirty persons."
9,9,23,"And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee."
9,9,24,"And the cook took up the thigh, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And `Samuel' said, Behold, that which hath been reserved! set it before thee and eat; because unto the appointed time hath it been kept for thee, for I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day."
9,9,25,"And when they were come down from the high place into the city, he communed with Saul upon the housetop."
9,9,26,"And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad."
9,9,27,"As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us (and he passed on), but stand thou still first, that I may cause thee to hear the word of God."
9,10,1,"Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not that Jehovah hath anointed thee to be prince over his inheritance?"
9,10,2,"When thou art departed from me to-day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre, in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found; and, lo, thy father hath left off caring for the asses, and is anxious for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?"
9,10,3,"Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the oak of Tabor; and there shall meet thee there three men going up to God to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:"
9,10,4,"and they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread, which thou shalt receive of their hand."
9,10,5,"After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a timbrel, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they will be prophesying:"
9,10,6,"and the Spirit of Jehovah will come mightily upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man."
9,10,7,"And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion shall serve thee; for God is with thee."
9,10,8,"And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt-offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come unto thee, and show thee what thou shalt do."
9,10,9,"And it was so, that, when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day."
9,10,10,"And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily upon him, and he prophesied among them."
9,10,11,"And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?"
9,10,12,"And one of the same place answered and said, And who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?"
9,10,13,"And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place."
9,10,14,"And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses; and when we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel."
9,10,15,"And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you."
9,10,16,"And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But concerning the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not."
9,10,17,"And Samuel called the people together unto Jehovah to Mizpah;"
9,10,18,"and he said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you:"
9,10,19,"but ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saveth you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and ye have said unto him, `Nay', but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before Jehovah by your tribes, and by your thousands."
9,10,20,"So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken."
9,10,21,"And he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families; and the family of the Matrites was taken; and Saul the son of Kish was taken: but when they sought him, he could not be found."
9,10,22,"Therefore they asked of Jehovah further, Is there yet a man to come hither? And Jehovah answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the baggage."
9,10,23,"And they ran and fetched him thence; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward."
9,10,24,"And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom Jehovah hath chosen, that there is none like him along all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, `Long' live the king."
9,10,25,"Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before Jehovah. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house."
9,10,26,"And Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and there went with him the host, whose hearts God had touched."
9,10,27,"But certain worthless fellows said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no present. But he held his peace."
9,11,1,"Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee."
9,11,2,"And Nahash the Ammonite said unto them, On this condition will I make it with you, that all your right eyes be put out; and I will lay it for a reproach upon all Israel."
9,11,3,"And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers unto all the borders of Israel; and then, if there be none to save us, we will come out to thee."
9,11,4,"Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and spake these words in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept."
9,11,5,"And, behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the words of the men of Jabesh."
9,11,6,"And the Spirit of God came mightily upon Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled greatly."
9,11,7,"And he took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the dread of Jehovah fell on the people, and they came out as one man."
9,11,8,"And he numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand."
9,11,9,"And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, To-morrow, by the time the sun is hot, ye shall have deliverance. And the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad."
9,11,10,"Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To-morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you."
9,11,11,"And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and smote the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they that remained were scattered, so that not two of them were left together."
9,11,12,"And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death."
9,11,13,"And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day; for to-day Jehovah hath wrought deliverance in Israel."
9,11,14,"Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there."
9,11,15,"And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before Jehovah in Gilgal; and there they offered sacrifices of peace-offerings before Jehovah; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly."
9,12,1,"And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you."
9,12,2,"And now, behold, the king walketh before you; and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my youth unto this day."
9,12,3,"Here I am: witness against me before Jehovah, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I taken a ransom to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you."
9,12,4,"And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken aught of any man's hand."
9,12,5,"And he said unto them, Jehovah is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found aught in my hand. And they said, He is witness."
9,12,6,"And Samuel said unto the people, It is Jehovah that appointed Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt."
9,12,7,"Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before Jehovah concerning all the righteous acts of Jehovah, which he did to you and to your fathers."
9,12,8,"When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto Jehovah, then Jehovah sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them to dwell in this place."
9,12,9,"But they forgat Jehovah their God; and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab; and they fought against them."
9,12,10,"And they cried unto Jehovah, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken Jehovah, and have served the Baalim and the Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee."
9,12,11,"And Jehovah sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side; and ye dwelt in safety."
9,12,12,"And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay, but a king shall reign over us; when Jehovah your God was your king."
9,12,13,"Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have asked for: and, behold, Jehovah hath set a king over you."
9,12,14,"If ye will fear Jehovah, and serve him, and hearken unto his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of Jehovah, and both ye and also the king that reigneth over you be followers of Jehovah your God, `well':"
9,12,15,"but if ye will not hearken unto the voice of Jehovah, but rebel against the commandment of Jehovah, then will the hand of Jehovah be against you, as it was against your fathers."
9,12,16,"Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which Jehovah will do before your eyes."
9,12,17,"Is it not wheat harvest to-day? I will call unto Jehovah, that he may send thunder and rain; and ye shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of Jehovah, in asking you a king."
9,12,18,"So Samuel called unto Jehovah; and Jehovah sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared Jehovah and Samuel."
9,12,19,"And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto Jehovah thy God, that we die not; for we have added unto all our sins `this' evil, to ask us a king."
9,12,20,"And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not; ye have indeed done all this evil; yet turn not aside from following Jehovah, but serve Jehovah with all your heart:"
9,12,21,"and turn ye not aside; for `then would ye go' after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver, for they are vain."
9,12,22,"For Jehovah will not forsake his people for his great name's sake, because it hath pleased Jehovah to make you a people unto himself."
9,12,23,"Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Jehovah in ceasing to pray for you: but I will instruct you in the good and the right way."
9,12,24,"Only fear Jehovah, and serve him in truth with all your heart; for consider how great things he hath done for you."
9,12,25,"But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king."
9,13,1,"Saul was `forty' years old when he began to reign; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,"
9,13,2,"Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel, whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the mount of Beth-el, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent."
9,13,3,"And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba: and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear."
9,13,4,"And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal."
9,13,5,"And the Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea-shore in multitude: and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth-aven."
9,13,6,"When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed), then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in coverts, and in pits."
9,13,7,"Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling."
9,13,8,"And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel `had appointed': but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him."
9,13,9,"And Saul said, Bring hither the burnt-offering to me, and the peace-offerings. And he offered the burnt-offering."
9,13,10,"And it came to pass that, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him."
9,13,11,"And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash;"
9,13,12,"therefore said I, Now will the Philistines come down upon me to Gilgal, and I have not entreated the favor of Jehovah: I forced myself therefore, and offered the burnt-offering."
9,13,13,"And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly; thou hast not kept the commandment of Jehovah thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would Jehovah have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever."
9,13,14,"But now thy kingdom shall not continue: Jehovah hath sought him a man after his own heart, and Jehovah hath appointed him to be prince over his people, because thou hast not kept that which Jehovah commanded thee."
9,13,15,"And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men."
9,13,16,"And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Geba of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash."
9,13,17,"And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual;"
9,13,18,"and another company turned the way to Beth-horon; and another company turned the way of the border that looketh down upon the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness."
9,13,19,"Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:"
9,13,20,"but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock;"
9,13,21,"yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to set the goads."
9,13,22,"So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found."
9,13,23,"And the garrison of the Philistines went out unto the pass of Michmash."
9,14,1,"Now it fell upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armor, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on yonder side. But he told not his father."
9,14,2,"And Saul abode in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate-tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;"
9,14,3,"and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of Jehovah in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone."
9,14,4,"And between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh."
9,14,5,"The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba."
9,14,6,"And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armor, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that Jehovah will work for us; for there is no restraint to Jehovah to save by many or by few."
9,14,7,"And his armorbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thy heart: turn thee, behold, I am with thee according to thy heart."
9,14,8,"Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto the men, and we will disclose ourselves unto them."
9,14,9,"If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them."
9,14,10,"But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up; for Jehovah hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be the sign unto us."
9,14,11,"And both of them disclosed themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves."
9,14,12,"And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armorbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armorbearer, Come up after me; for Jehovah hath delivered them into the hand of Israel."
9,14,13,"And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armorbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armorbearer slew them after him."
9,14,14,"And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armorbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow's length in an acre of land."
9,14,15,"And there was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled; and the earth quaked: so there was an exceeding great trembling."
9,14,16,"And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went `hither' and thither."
9,14,17,"Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armorbearer were not there."
9,14,18,"And Saul said unto Ahijah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was `there' at that time with the children of Israel."
9,14,19,"And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thy hand."
9,14,20,"And Saul and all the people that were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, `and there was' a very great discomfiture."
9,14,21,"Now the Hebrews that were with the Philistines as beforetime, and that went up with them into the camp, `from the country' round about, even they also `turned' to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan."
9,14,22,"Likewise all the men of Israel that had hid themselves in the hill-country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle."
9,14,23,"So Jehovah saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over by Beth-aven."
9,14,24,"And the men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until it be evening, and I be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted food."
9,14,25,"And all the people came into the forest; and there was honey upon the ground."
9,14,26,"And when the people were come unto the forest, behold, the honey dropped: but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath."
9,14,27,"But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened."
9,14,28,"Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth food this day. And the people were faint."
9,14,29,"Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey."
9,14,30,"How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to-day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for now hath there been no great slaughter among the Philistines."
9,14,31,"And they smote of the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. And the people were very faint;"
9,14,32,"and the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground; and the people did eat them with the blood."
9,14,33,"Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against Jehovah, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, ye have dealt treacherously: roll a great stone unto me this day."
9,14,34,"And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against Jehovah in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there."
9,14,35,"And Saul built an altar unto Jehovah: the same was the first altar that he built unto Jehovah."
9,14,36,"And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and take spoil among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God."
9,14,37,"And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day."
9,14,38,"And Saul said, Draw nigh hither, all ye chiefs of the people; and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day."
9,14,39,"For, as Jehovah liveth, who saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him."
9,14,40,"Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee."
9,14,41,"Therefore Saul said unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, Show the right. And Jonathan and Saul were taken `by lot'; but the people escaped."
9,14,42,"And Saul said, Cast `lots' between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken."
9,14,43,"Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did certainly taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and, lo, I must die."
9,14,44,"And Saul said, God do so and more also; for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan."
9,14,45,"And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? Far from it: as Jehovah liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not."
9,14,46,"Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place."
9,14,47,"Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he put `them' to the worse."
9,14,48,"And he did valiantly, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that despoiled them."
9,14,49,"Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the first-born Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:"
9,14,50,"and the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the captain of his host was Abner the son of Ner, Saul's uncle."
9,14,51,"And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel."
9,14,52,"And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him."
9,15,1,"And Samuel said unto Saul, Jehovah sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of Jehovah."
9,15,2,"Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I have marked that which Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way, when he came up out of Egypt."
9,15,3,"Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass."
9,15,4,"And Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah."
9,15,5,"And Saul came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley."
9,15,6,"And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites."
9,15,7,"And Saul smote the Amalekites, from Havilah as thou goest to Shur, that is before Egypt."
9,15,8,"And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword."
9,15,9,"But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly."
9,15,10,"Then came the word of Jehovah unto Samuel, saying,"
9,15,11,"It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And Samuel was wroth; and he cried unto Jehovah all night."
9,15,12,"And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a monument, and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal."
9,15,13,"And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of Jehovah: I have performed the commandment of Jehovah."
9,15,14,"And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?"
9,15,15,"And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto Jehovah thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed."
9,15,16,"Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what Jehovah hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on."
9,15,17,"And Samuel said, Though thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel? And Jehovah anointed thee king over Israel;"
9,15,18,"and Jehovah sent thee on a journey, and said, Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed."
9,15,19,"Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of Jehovah, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah?"
9,15,20,"And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of Jehovah, and have gone the way which Jehovah sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites."
9,15,21,"But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice unto Jehovah thy God in Gilgal."
9,15,22,"And Samuel said, Hath Jehovah as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Jehovah? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams."
9,15,23,"For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, he hath also rejected thee from being king."
9,15,24,"And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Jehovah, and thy words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice."
9,15,25,"Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Jehovah."
9,15,26,"And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee; for thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah hath rejected thee from being king over Israel."
9,15,27,"And as Samuel turned about to go away, `Saul' laid hold upon the skirt of his robe, and it rent."
9,15,28,"And Samuel said unto him, Jehovah hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbor of thine, that is better than thou."
9,15,29,"And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent."
9,15,30,"Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship Jehovah thy God."
9,15,31,"So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped Jehovah."
9,15,32,"Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him cheerfully. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past."
9,15,33,"And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before Jehovah in Gilgal."
9,15,34,"Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul."
9,15,35,"And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul: and Jehovah repented that he had made Saul king over Israel."
9,16,1,"And Jehovah said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from being king over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go: I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite; for I have provided me a king among his sons."
9,16,2,"And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And Jehovah said, Take a heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to Jehovah."
9,16,3,"And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee."
9,16,4,"And Samuel did that which Jehovah spake, and came to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, Comest thou peaceably?"
9,16,5,"And he said, Peaceably; I am come to sacrifice unto Jehovah: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice."
9,16,6,"And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely Jehovah's anointed is before him."
9,16,7,"But Jehovah said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him: for `Jehovah seeth' not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but Jehovah looketh on the heart."
9,16,8,"Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath Jehovah chosen this."
9,16,9,"Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath Jehovah chosen this."
9,16,10,"And Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Jehovah hath not chosen these."
9,16,11,"And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he is keeping the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down till he come hither."
9,16,12,"And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look upon. And Jehovah said, Arise, anoint him; for this is he."
9,16,13,"Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah."
9,16,14,"Now the Spirit of Jehovah departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Jehovah troubled him."
9,16,15,"And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee."
9,16,16,"Let our lord now command thy servants, that are before thee, to seek out a man who is a skilful player on the harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well."
9,16,17,"And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me."
9,16,18,"Then answered one of the young men, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, that is skilful in playing, and a mighty man of valor, and a man of war, and prudent in speech, and a comely person; and Jehovah is with him."
9,16,19,"Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, who is with the sheep."
9,16,20,"And Jesse took an ass `laden' with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul."
9,16,21,"And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armorbearer."
9,16,22,"And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favor in my sight."
9,16,23,"And it came to pass, when the `evil' spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him."
9,17,1,"Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle; and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongeth to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim."
9,17,2,"And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and encamped in the vale of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines."
9,17,3,"And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them."
9,17,4,"And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span."
9,17,5,"And he had a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was clad with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass."
9,17,6,"And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a javelin of brass between his shoulders."
9,17,7,"And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head `weighed' six hundred shekels of iron: and his shield-bearer went before him."
9,17,8,"And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me."
9,17,9,"If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us."
9,17,10,"And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together."
9,17,11,"And when Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid."
9,17,12,"Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man was an old man in the days of Saul, stricken `in years' among men."
9,17,13,"And the three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the first-born, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah."
9,17,14,"And David was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saul."
9,17,15,"Now David went to and fro from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Beth-lehem."
9,17,16,"And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days."
9,17,17,"And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry `them' quickly to the camp to thy brethren;"
9,17,18,"and bring these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge."
9,17,19,"Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the vale of Elah, fighting with the Philistines."
9,17,20,"And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the place of the wagons, as the host which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle."
9,17,21,"And Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army."
9,17,22,"And David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the army, and came and saluted his brethren."
9,17,23,"And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them."
9,17,24,"And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid."
9,17,25,"And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel."
9,17,26,"And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?"
9,17,27,"And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him."
9,17,28,"And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why art thou come down? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thy heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle."
9,17,29,"And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?"
9,17,30,"And he turned away from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner."
9,17,31,"And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him."
9,17,32,"And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine."
9,17,33,"And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth."
9,17,34,"And David said unto Saul, Thy servant was keeping his father's sheep; and when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock,"
9,17,35,"I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth; and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him."
9,17,36,"Thy servant smote both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God."
9,17,37,"And David said, Jehovah that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and Jehovah shall be with thee."
9,17,38,"And Saul clad David with his apparel, and he put a helmet of brass upon his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail."
9,17,39,"And David girded his sword upon his apparel, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him."
9,17,40,"And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd's bag which he had, even in his wallet; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine."
9,17,41,"And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him."
9,17,42,"And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and withal of a fair countenance."
9,17,43,"And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods."
9,17,44,"And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the birds of the heavens, and to the beasts of the field."
9,17,45,"Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin: but I come to thee in the name of Jehovah of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied."
9,17,46,"This day will Jehovah deliver thee into my hand; and I will smite thee, and take thy head from off thee; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day unto the birds of the heavens, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,"
9,17,47,"and that all this assembly may know that Jehovah saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is Jehovah's, and he will give you into our hand."
9,17,48,"And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine."
9,17,49,"And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead; and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell upon his face to the earth."
9,17,50,"So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David."
9,17,51,"Then David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled."
9,17,52,"And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou comest to Gai, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron."
9,17,53,"And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they plundered their camp."
9,17,54,"And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent."
9,17,55,"And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell."
9,17,56,"And the king said, Inquire thou whose son the stripling is."
9,17,57,"And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand."
9,17,58,"And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite."
9,18,1,"And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul."
9,18,2,"And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house."
9,18,3,"Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul."
9,18,4,"And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his apparel, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle."
9,18,5,"And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, `and' behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and it was good in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants."
9,18,6,"And it came to pass as they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with timbrels, with joy, and with instruments of music."
9,18,7,"And the women sang one to another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands."
9,18,8,"And Saul was very wroth, and this saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?"
9,18,9,"And Saul eyed David from that day and forward."
9,18,10,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as he did day by day. And Saul had his spear in his hand;"
9,18,11,"and Saul cast the spear; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall. And David avoided out of his presence twice."
9,18,12,"And Saul was afraid of David, because Jehovah was with him, and was departed from Saul."
9,18,13,"Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people."
9,18,14,"And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and Jehovah was with him."
9,18,15,"And when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he stood in awe of him."
9,18,16,"But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came in before them."
9,18,17,"And Saul said to David, Behold, my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight Jehovah's battles. For Saul said, Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him."
9,18,18,"And David said unto Saul, Who am I, and what is my life, `or' my father's family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?"
9,18,19,"But it came to pass at the time when Merab, Saul's daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife."
9,18,20,"And Michal, Saul's daughter, loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him."
9,18,21,"And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law a second time."
9,18,22,"And Saul commanded his servants, `saying', Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son-in-law."
9,18,23,"And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be the king's son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?"
9,18,24,"And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David."
9,18,25,"And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines."
9,18,26,"And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son-in-law. And the days were not expired;"
9,18,27,"and David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife."
9,18,28,"And Saul saw and knew that Jehovah was with David; and Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him."
9,18,29,"And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was David's enemy continually."
9,18,30,"Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, as often as they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by."
9,19,1,"And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should slay David. But Jonathan, Saul's son, delighted much in David."
9,19,2,"And Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to slay thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself in the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:"
9,19,3,"and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and if I see aught, I will tell thee."
9,19,4,"And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good:"
9,19,5,"for he put his life in his hand, and smote the Philistine, and Jehovah wrought a great victory for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice; wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?"
9,19,6,"And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As Jehovah liveth, he shall not be put to death."
9,19,7,"And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as beforetime."
9,19,8,"And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled before him."
9,19,9,"And an evil spirit from Jehovah was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand; and David was playing with his hand."
9,19,10,"And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the spear; but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the spear into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night."
9,19,11,"And Saul sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal, David's wife, told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to-night, to-morrow thou wilt be slain."
9,19,12,"So Michal let David down through the window: and he went, and fled, and escaped."
9,19,13,"And Michal took the teraphim, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' `hair' at the head thereof, and covered it with the clothes."
9,19,14,"And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick."
9,19,15,"And Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him."
9,19,16,"And when the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the pillow of goats' `hair' at the head thereof."
9,19,17,"And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me thus, and let mine enemy go, so that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?"
9,19,18,"Now David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth."
9,19,19,"And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah."
9,19,20,"And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied."
9,19,21,"And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied."
9,19,22,"Then went he also to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah."
9,19,23,"And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God came upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah."
9,19,24,"And he also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?"
9,20,1,"And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?"
9,20,2,"And he said unto him, Far from it; thou shalt not die: behold, my father doeth nothing either great or small, but that he discloseth it unto me; and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so."
9,20,3,"And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father knoweth well that I have found favor in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death."
9,20,4,"Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee."
9,20,5,"And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to-morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even."
9,20,6,"If thy father miss me at all, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Beth-lehem his city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family."
9,20,7,"If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be wroth, then know that evil is determined by him."
9,20,8,"Therefore deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of Jehovah with thee: but if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?"
9,20,9,"And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?"
9,20,10,"Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me if perchance thy father answer thee roughly?"
9,20,11,"And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field."
9,20,12,"And Jonathan said unto David, Jehovah, the God of Israel, `be witness': when I have sounded my father about this time to-morrow, `or' the third day, behold, if there be good toward David, shall I not then send unto thee, and disclose it unto thee?"
9,20,13,"Jehovah do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do thee evil, if I disclose it not unto thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and Jehovah be with thee, as he hath been with my father."
9,20,14,"And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the lovingkindness of Jehovah, that I die not;"
9,20,15,"but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever; no, not when Jehovah hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth."
9,20,16,"So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, `saying', And Jehovah will require it at the hand of David's enemies."
9,20,17,"And Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul."
9,20,18,"Then Jonathan said unto him, To-morrow is the new moon: and thou wilt be missed, because thy seat will be empty."
9,20,19,"And when thou hast stayed three days, thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel."
9,20,20,"And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark."
9,20,21,"And, behold, I will send the lad, `saying', Go, find the arrows. If I say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee; take them, and come; for there is peace to thee and no hurt, as Jehovah liveth."
9,20,22,"But if I say thus unto the boy, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way; for Jehovah hath sent thee away."
9,20,23,"And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, Jehovah is between thee and me for ever."
9,20,24,"So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat food."
9,20,25,"And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul's side: but David's place was empty."
9,20,26,"Nevertheless Saul spake not anything that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean."
9,20,27,"And it came to pass on the morrow after the new moon, `which was' the second `day', that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to-day?"
9,20,28,"And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem:"
9,20,29,"and he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me `to be there': and now, if I have found favor in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he is not come unto the king's table."
9,20,30,"Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of a perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own shame, and unto the shame of thy mother's nakedness?"
9,20,31,"For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die."
9,20,32,"And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore should he be put to death? what hath he done?"
9,20,33,"And Saul cast his spear at him to smite him; whereby Jonathan knew that is was determined of his father to put David to death."
9,20,34,"So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame."
9,20,35,"And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him."
9,20,36,"And he said unto his lad, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him."
9,20,37,"And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?"
9,20,38,"And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master."
9,20,39,"But the lad knew not anything: only Jonathan and David knew the matter."
9,20,40,"And Jonathan gave his weapons unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city."
9,20,41,"And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of `a place' toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded."
9,20,42,"And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of Jehovah, saying, Jehovah shall be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed, for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city."
9,21,1,"Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?"
9,21,2,"And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know anything of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed the young men to such and such a place."
9,21,3,"Now therefore what is under thy hand? give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatsoever there is present."
9,21,4,"And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women."
9,21,5,"And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days; when I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was but a common journey; how much more then to-day shall their vessels be holy?"
9,21,6,"So the priest gave him holy `bread'; for there was no bread there but the showbread, that was taken from before Jehovah, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away."
9,21,7,"Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Jehovah; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chiefest of the herdsmen that belonged to Saul."
9,21,8,"And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thy hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste."
9,21,9,"And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the vale of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it; for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me."
9,21,10,"And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath."
9,21,11,"And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands?"
9,21,12,"And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath."
9,21,13,"And he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard."
9,21,14,"Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad; wherefore then have ye brought him to me?"
9,21,15,"Do I lack madmen, that ye have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?"
9,22,1,"David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave of Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him."
9,22,2,"And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men."
9,22,3,"And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, `and be' with you, till I know what God will do for me."
9,22,4,"And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the stronghold."
9,22,5,"And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the stronghold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hereth."
9,22,6,"And Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him: now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk-tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him."
9,22,7,"And Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,"
9,22,8,"that all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that discloseth to me when my son maketh a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or discloseth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?"
9,22,9,"Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub."
9,22,10,"And he inquired of Jehovah for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine."
9,22,11,"Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king."
9,22,12,"And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord."
9,22,13,"And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?"
9,22,14,"Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who among all thy servants is so faithful as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and is taken into thy council, and is honorable in thy house?"
9,22,15,"Have I to-day begun to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute anything unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father; for thy servant knoweth nothing of all this, less or more."
9,22,16,"And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house."
9,22,17,"And the king said unto the guard that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of Jehovah; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew that he fled, and did not disclose it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of Jehovah."
9,22,18,"And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and he slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod."
9,22,19,"And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen and asses and sheep, with the edge of the sword."
9,22,20,"And one of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David."
9,22,21,"And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain Jehovah's priests."
9,22,22,"And David said unto Abiathar, I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned `the death' of all the persons of thy father's house."
9,22,23,"Abide thou with me, fear not; for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: for with me thou shalt be in safeguard."
9,23,1,"And they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and are robbing the threshing-floors."
9,23,2,"Therefore David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And Jehovah said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah."
9,23,3,"And David's men said unto him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?"
9,23,4,"Then David inquired of Jehovah yet again. And Jehovah answered him, and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand."
9,23,5,"And David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and slew them with a great slaughter. So David save the inhabitants of Keilah."
9,23,6,"And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand."
9,23,7,"And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars."
9,23,8,"And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men."
9,23,9,"And David knew that Saul was devising mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod."
9,23,10,"Then said David, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, thy servant hath surely heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake."
9,23,11,"Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O Jehovah, the God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And Jehovah said, He will come down."
9,23,12,"Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver up to me and my men into the hand of Saul? And Jehovah said, They will deliver thee up."
9,23,13,"Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth."
9,23,14,"And David abode in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill-country in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand."
9,23,15,"And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the wood."
9,23,16,"And Jonathan, Saul's son, arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God."
9,23,17,"And he said unto him, Fear not; for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth."
9,23,18,"And they two made a covenant before Jehovah: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house."
9,23,19,"Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert?"
9,23,20,"Now therefore, O king, come down, according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him up into the king's hand."
9,23,21,"And Saul said, Blessed be ye of Jehovah; for ye have had compassion on me."
9,23,22,"Go, I pray you, make yet more sure, and know and see his place where his haunt is, `and' who hath seen him there; for it is told me that he dealeth very subtly."
9,23,23,"See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking-places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me of a certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah."
9,23,24,"And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south of the desert."
9,23,25,"And Saul and his men went to seek him. And they told David: wherefore he came down to the rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard `that', he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon."
9,23,26,"And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them."
9,23,27,"But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have made a raid upon the land."
9,23,28,"So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela-hammahlekoth."
9,23,29,"And David went up from thence, and dwelt in the strongholds of En-gedi."
9,24,1,"And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi."
9,24,2,"Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats."
9,24,3,"And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet. Now David and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave."
9,24,4,"And the men of David said unto him, Behold, the day of which Jehovah said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thy hand, and thou shalt do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily."
9,24,5,"And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt."
9,24,6,"And he said unto his men, Jehovah forbid that I should do this thing unto my lord, Jehovah's anointed, to put forth my hand against him, seeing he is Jehovah's anointed."
9,24,7,"So David checked his men with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. And Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way."
9,24,8,"David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and did obeisance."
9,24,9,"And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearkenest thou to men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?"
9,24,10,"Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that Jehovah had delivered thee to-day into my hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee; but `mine eye' spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is Jehovah's anointed."
9,24,11,"Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against thee, though thou huntest after my life to take it."
9,24,12,"Jehovah judge between me and thee, and Jehovah avenge me of thee; but my hand shall not be upon thee."
9,24,13,"As saith the proverb of the ancients, Out of the wicked cometh forth wickedness; but my hand shall not be upon thee."
9,24,14,"After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea."
9,24,15,"Jehovah therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thy hand."
9,24,16,"And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept."
9,24,17,"And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I; for thou hast rendered unto me good, whereas I have rendered unto thee evil."
9,24,18,"And thou hast declared this day how that thou hast dealt well with me, forasmuch as when Jehovah had delivered me up into thy hand, thou killedst me not."
9,24,19,"For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore Jehovah reward thee good for that which thou hast done unto me this day."
9,24,20,"And now, behold, I know that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thy hand."
9,24,21,"Swear now therefore unto me by Jehovah, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house."
9,24,22,"And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the stronghold."
9,25,1,"And Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran."
9,25,2,"And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel."
9,25,3,"Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail; and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb."
9,25,4,"And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep."
9,25,5,"And David sent ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:"
9,25,6,"and thus shall ye say to him that liveth `in prosperity', Peace be unto thee, and peace be to thy house, and peace be unto all that thou hast."
9,25,7,"And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: thy shepherds have now been with us, and we did them no hurt, neither was there aught missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel."
9,25,8,"Ask thy young men, and they will tell thee: wherefore let the young men find favor in thine eyes; for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thy hand, unto thy servants, and to thy son David."
9,25,9,"And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased."
9,25,10,"And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there are many servants now-a-days that break away every man from his master."
9,25,11,"Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men of whom I know not whence they are?"
9,25,12,"So David's young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him according to all these words."
9,25,13,"And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the baggage."
9,25,14,"But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed at them."
9,25,15,"But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields:"
9,25,16,"they were a wall unto us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep."
9,25,17,"Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house: for he is such a worthless fellow, that one cannot speak to him."
9,25,18,"Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched grain, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses."
9,25,19,"And she said unto her young men, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal."
9,25,20,"And it was so, as she rode on her ass, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that, behold, David and his men came down toward her; and she met them."
9,25,21,"Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath returned me evil for good."
9,25,22,"God do so unto the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light so much as one man-child."
9,25,23,"And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and alighted from her ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground."
9,25,24,"And she fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me be the iniquity; and let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine ears, and hear thou the words of thy handmaid."
9,25,25,"Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this worthless fellow, even Nabal; for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thy handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send."
9,25,26,"Now therefore, my lord, as Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing Jehovah hath withholden thee from bloodguiltiness, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now therefore let thine enemies, and them that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal."
9,25,27,"And now this present which thy servant hath brought unto my lord, let it be given unto the young men that follow my lord."
9,25,28,"Forgive, I pray thee, the trespass of thy handmaid: for Jehovah will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord fighteth the battles of Jehovah; and evil shall not be found in thee all thy days."
9,25,29,"And though men be risen up to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul, yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with Jehovah thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as from the hollow of a sling."
9,25,30,"And it shall come to pass, when Jehovah shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee prince over Israel,"
9,25,31,"that this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood without cause, or that my lord hath avenged himself. And when Jehovah shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thy handmaid."
9,25,32,"And David said to Abigail, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me:"
9,25,33,"and blessed be thy discretion, and blessed be thou, that hast kept me this day from bloodguiltiness, and from avenging myself with mine own hand."
9,25,34,"For in very deed, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, liveth, who hath withholden me from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light so much as one man-child."
9,25,35,"So David received of her hand that which she had brought him: and he said unto her, Go up in peace to thy house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person."
9,25,36,"And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light."
9,25,37,"And it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone."
9,25,38,"And it came to pass about ten days after, that Jehovah smote Nabal, so that he died."
9,25,39,"And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be Jehovah, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept back his servant from evil: and the evil-doing of Nabal hath Jehovah returned upon his own head. And David sent and spake concerning Abigail, to take her to him to wife."
9,25,40,"And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David hath sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife."
9,25,41,"And she arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, Behold, thy handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord."
9,25,42,"And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife."
9,25,43,"David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they became both of them his wives."
9,25,44,"Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim."
9,26,1,"And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert?"
9,26,2,"Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph."
9,26,3,"And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness."
9,26,4,"David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come of a certainty."
9,26,5,"And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay within the place of the wagons, and the people were encamped round about him."
9,26,6,"Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee."
9,26,7,"So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay round about him."
9,26,8,"Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered up thine enemy into thy hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not smite him the second time."
9,26,9,"And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not; for who can put forth his hand against Jehovah's anointed, and be guiltless?"
9,26,10,"And David said, As Jehovah liveth, Jehovah will smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle and perish."
9,26,11,"Jehovah forbid that I should put forth my hand against Jehovah's anointed: but now take, I pray thee, the spear that is at his head, and the cruse of water, and let us go."
9,26,12,"So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's head; and they gat them away: and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from Jehovah was fallen upon them."
9,26,13,"Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them;"
9,26,14,"and David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?"
9,26,15,"And David said to Abner, Art not thou a `valiant' man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept watch over thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord."
9,26,16,"This thing is not good that thou hast done. As Jehovah liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept watch over your lord, Jehovah's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his head."
9,26,17,"And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king."
9,26,18,"And he said, Wherefore doth my lord pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in my hand?"
9,26,19,"Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it be Jehovah that hath stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if it be the children of men, cursed be they before Jehovah: for they have driven me out this day that I should not cleave unto the inheritance of Jehovah, saying, Go, serve other gods."
9,26,20,"Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of Jehovah: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains."
9,26,21,"Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David; for I will no more do thee harm, because my life was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly."
9,26,22,"And David answered and said, Behold the spear, O king! let then one of the young men come over and fetch it."
9,26,23,"And Jehovah will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; forasmuch as Jehovah delivered thee into my hand to-day, and I would not put forth my hand against Jehovah's anointed."
9,26,24,"And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of Jehovah, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation."
9,26,25,"Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do mightily, and shalt surely prevail. So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place."
9,27,1,"And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand."
9,27,2,"And David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men that were with him, unto Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath."
9,27,3,"And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife."
9,27,4,"And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him."
9,27,5,"And David said unto Achish, If now I have found favor in thine eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?"
9,27,6,"Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day."
9,27,7,"And the number of the days that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months."
9,27,8,"And David and his men went up, and made a raid upon the Geshurites, and the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for those `nations' were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt."
9,27,9,"And David smote the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel; and he returned, and came to Achish."
9,27,10,"And Achish said, Against whom have ye made a raid to-day? And David said, Against the South of Judah, and against the South of the Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites."
9,27,11,"And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell of us, saying, So did David, and so hath been his manner all the while he hath dwelt in the country of the Philistines."
9,27,12,"And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever."
9,28,1,"And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their hosts together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me in the host, thou and thy men."
9,28,2,"And David said to Achish, Therefore thou shalt know what thy servant will do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of my head for ever."
9,28,3,"Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land."
9,28,4,"And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa."
9,28,5,"And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly."
9,28,6,"And when Saul inquired of Jehovah, Jehovah answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets."
9,28,7,"Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at En-dor."
9,28,8,"And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, Divine unto me, I pray thee, by the familiar spirit, and bring me up whomsoever I shall name unto thee."
9,28,9,"And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?"
9,28,10,"And Saul sware to her by Jehovah, saying, As Jehovah liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing."
9,28,11,"Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel."
9,28,12,"And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice; and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul."
9,28,13,"And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what seest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I see a god coming up out of the earth."
9,28,14,"And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a robe. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance."
9,28,15,"And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do."
9,28,16,"And Samuel said, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing Jehovah is departed from thee, and is become thine adversary?"
9,28,17,"And Jehovah hath done unto thee, as he spake by me: and Jehovah hath rent the kingdom out of thy hand, and given it to thy neighbor, even to David."
9,28,18,"Because thou obeyedst not the voice of Jehovah, and didst not execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath Jehovah done this thing unto thee this day."
9,28,19,"Moreover Jehovah will deliver Israel also with thee into the hand of the Philistines; and to-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: Jehovah will deliver the host of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines."
9,28,20,"Then Saul fell straightway his full length upon the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night."
9,28,21,"And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thy handmaid hath hearkened unto thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me."
9,28,22,"Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way."
9,28,23,"But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, constrained him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed."
9,28,24,"And the woman had a fatted calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:"
9,28,25,"and she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night."
9,29,1,"Now the Philistines gathered together all their hosts to Aphek: and the Israelites encamped by the fountain which is in Jezreel."
9,29,2,"And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands; and David and his men passed on in the rearward with Achish."
9,29,3,"Then said the princes of the Philistines, What `do' these Hebrews `here'? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who hath been with me these days, or `rather' these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell away `unto me' unto this day?"
9,29,4,"But he princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make the man return, that he may go back to his place where thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us: for wherewith should this `fellow' reconcile himself unto his lord? should it not be with the heads of these men?"
9,29,5,"Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands?"
9,29,6,"Then Achish called David, and said unto him, As Jehovah liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight; for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favor thee not."
9,29,7,"Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines."
9,29,8,"And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been before thee unto this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"
9,29,9,"And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle."
9,29,10,"Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of thy lord that are come with thee; and as soon as ye are up early in the morning, and have light, depart."
9,29,11,"So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel."
9,30,1,"And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid upon the South, and upon Ziklag, and had smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire,"
9,30,2,"and had taken captive the women `and all' that were therein, both small and great: they slew not any, but carried them off, and went their way."
9,30,3,"And when David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captive."
9,30,4,"Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep."
9,30,5,"And David's two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite."
9,30,6,"And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David strengthened himself in Jehovah his God."
9,30,7,"And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David."
9,30,8,"And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, If I pursue after this troop, shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue; for thou shalt surely overtake `them', and shalt without fail recover `all'."
9,30,9,"So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed."
9,30,10,"But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor."
9,30,11,"And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they gave him water to drink."
9,30,12,"And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him; for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights."
9,30,13,"And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick."
9,30,14,"We made a raid upon the South of the Cherethites, and upon that which belongeth to Judah, and upon the South of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire."
9,30,15,"And David said to him, Wilt thou bring me down to this troop? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this troop."
9,30,16,"And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the ground, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah."
9,30,17,"And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, who rode upon camels and fled."
9,30,18,"And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives."
9,30,19,"And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor anything that they had taken to them: David brought back all."
9,30,20,"And David took all the flocks and the herds, `which' they drove before those `other' cattle, and said, This is David's spoil."
9,30,21,"And David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to abide at the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them."
9,30,22,"Then answered all the wicked men and base fellows, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them aught of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that he may lead them away, and depart."
9,30,23,"Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which Jehovah hath given unto us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand."
9,30,24,"And who will hearken unto you in this matter? for as his share is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his share be that tarrieth by the baggage: they shall share alike."
9,30,25,"And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day."
9,30,26,"And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold, a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of Jehovah:"
9,30,27,"To them that were in Beth-el, and to them that were in Ramoth of the South, and to them that were in Jattir,"
9,30,28,"and to them that were in Aroer, and to them that were in Siphmoth, and to them that were in Eshtemoa,"
9,30,29,"and to them that were in Racal, and to them that were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them that were in the cities of the Kenites,"
9,30,30,"and to them that were in Hormah, and to them that were in Bor-ashan, and to them that were in Athach,"
9,30,31,"and to them that were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt."
9,31,1,"Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa."
9,31,2,"And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul."
9,31,3,"And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was greatly distressed by reason of the archers."
9,31,4,"Then said Saul to his armorbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armorbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it."
9,31,5,"And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died with him."
9,31,6,"So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armorbearer, and all his men, that same day together."
9,31,7,"And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them."
9,31,8,"And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa."
9,31,9,"And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the tidings unto the house of their idols, and to the people."
9,31,10,"And they put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan."
9,31,11,"And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard concerning him that which the Philistines had done to Saul,"
9,31,12,"all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan; and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there."
9,31,13,"And they took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk-tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days."
10,1,1,"And it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;"
10,1,2,"it came to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance."
10,1,3,"And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped."
10,1,4,"And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also."
10,1,5,"And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?"
10,1,6,"And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him."
10,1,7,"And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I."
10,1,8,"And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite."
10,1,9,"And he said unto me, Stand, I pray thee, beside me, and slay me; for anguish hath taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me."
10,1,10,"So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord."
10,1,11,"Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:"
10,1,12,"and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Jehovah, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword."
10,1,13,"And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite."
10,1,14,"And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to destroy Jehovah's anointed?"
10,1,15,"And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him, so that he died."
10,1,16,"And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain Jehovah's anointed."
10,1,17,"And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:"
10,1,18,"(and he bade them teach the children of Judah `the song of' the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):"
10,1,19,"Thy glory, O Israel, is slain upon thy high places! How are the mighty fallen!"
10,1,20,"Tell it not in Gath, Publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph."
10,1,21,"Ye mountains of Gilboa, Let there be no dew nor rain upon you, neither fields of offerings: For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil."
10,1,22,"From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan turned not back, And the sword of Saul returned not empty."
10,1,23,"Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, And in their death they were not divided: They were swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions."
10,1,24,"Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, Who clothed you in scarlet delicately, Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel."
10,1,25,"How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain upon thy high places."
10,1,26,"I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: Very pleasant hast thou been unto me: Thy love to me was wonderful, Passing the love of women."
10,1,27,"How are the mighty fallen, And the weapons of war perished!"
10,2,1,"And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And Jehovah said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron."
10,2,2,"So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite."
10,2,3,"And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron."
10,2,4,"And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, The men of Jabesh-gilead were they that buried Saul."
10,2,5,"And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of Jehovah, that ye have showed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him."
10,2,6,"And now Jehovah show lovingkindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing."
10,2,7,"Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be ye valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them."
10,2,8,"Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, had taken Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;"
10,2,9,"and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel."
10,2,10,"Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David."
10,2,11,"And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months."
10,2,12,"And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon."
10,2,13,"And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool."
10,2,14,"And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men, I pray thee, arise and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise."
10,2,15,"Then they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David."
10,2,16,"And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and `thrust' his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon."
10,2,17,"And the battle was very sore that day: and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David."
10,2,18,"And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe."
10,2,19,"And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner."
10,2,20,"Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Is it thou, Asahel? And he answered, It is I."
10,2,21,"And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him."
10,2,22,"And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?"
10,2,23,"Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him in the body, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still."
10,2,24,"But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon."
10,2,25,"And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill."
10,2,26,"Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?"
10,2,27,"And Joab said, As God liveth, if thou hadst not spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone away, nor followed every one his brother."
10,2,28,"So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more."
10,2,29,"And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim."
10,2,30,"And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel."
10,2,31,"But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, `so that' three hundred and threescore men died."
10,2,32,"And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and the day brake upon them at Hebron."
10,3,1,"Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: and David waxed stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker."
10,3,2,"And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his first-born was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;"
10,3,3,"and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;"
10,3,4,"and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;"
10,3,5,"and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron."
10,3,6,"And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul."
10,3,7,"Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and `Ish-bosheth' said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?"
10,3,8,"Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head that belongeth to Judah? This day do I show kindness unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David; and yet thou chargest me this day with a fault concerning this woman."
10,3,9,"God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as Jehovah hath sworn to David, I do not even so to him;"
10,3,10,"to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba."
10,3,11,"And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him."
10,3,12,"And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying `also', Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee."
10,3,13,"And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee; but one thing I require of thee: that is, thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face."
10,3,14,"And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines."
10,3,15,"And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish."
10,3,16,"And her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return: and he returned."
10,3,17,"And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, In times past ye sought for David to be king over you:"
10,3,18,"now then do it; for Jehovah hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies."
10,3,19,"And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin."
10,3,20,"So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast."
10,3,21,"And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy soul desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace."
10,3,22,"And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace."
10,3,23,"When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace."
10,3,24,"Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?"
10,3,25,"Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest."
10,3,26,"And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not."
10,3,27,"And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother."
10,3,28,"And afterward, when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before Jehovah for ever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner:"
10,3,29,"let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth by the sword, or that lacketh bread."
10,3,30,"So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle."
10,3,31,"And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David followed the bier."
10,3,32,"And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept."
10,3,33,"And the king lamented for Abner, and said, Should Abner die as a fool dieth?"
10,3,34,"Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: As a man falleth before the children of iniquity, so didst thou fall. And all the people wept again over him."
10,3,35,"And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David sware, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or aught else, till the sun be down."
10,3,36,"And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people."
10,3,37,"So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner."
10,3,38,"And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?"
10,3,39,"And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me: Jehovah reward the evil-doer according to his wickedness."
10,4,1,"And when `Ish-bosheth', Saul's son, heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled."
10,4,2,"And `Ish-bosheth', Saul's son, `had' two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin (for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin:"
10,4,3,"and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have been sojourners there until this day)."
10,4,4,"Now Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel; and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth."
10,4,5,"And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, as he took his rest at noon."
10,4,6,"And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him in the body: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped."
10,4,7,"Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night."
10,4,8,"And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold, the head of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, thine enemy, who sought thy life; and Jehovah hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed."
10,4,9,"And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As Jehovah liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,"
10,4,10,"when one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his tidings."
10,4,11,"How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed, shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?"
10,4,12,"And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron."
10,5,1,"Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh."
10,5,2,"In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was thou that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and Jehovah said to thee, Thou shalt be shepherd of my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel."
10,5,3,"So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah: and they anointed David king over Israel."
10,5,4,"David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years."
10,5,5,"In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah."
10,5,6,"And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither; thinking, David cannot come in hither."
10,5,7,"Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David."
10,5,8,"And David said on that day, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites, let him get up to the watercourse, and `smite' the lame and the blind, that are hated of David's soul. Wherefore they say, There are the blind and the lame; he cannot come into the house."
10,5,9,"And David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward."
10,5,10,"And David waxed greater and greater; for Jehovah, the God of hosts, was with him."
10,5,11,"And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house."
10,5,12,"And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake."
10,5,13,"And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David."
10,5,14,"And these are the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,"
10,5,15,"and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,"
10,5,16,"and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet."
10,5,17,"And when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the stronghold."
10,5,18,"Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim."
10,5,19,"And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And Jehovah said unto David, Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into thy hand."
10,5,20,"And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and he said, Jehovah hath broken mine enemies before me, like the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim."
10,5,21,"And they left their images there; and David and his men took them away."
10,5,22,"And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim."
10,5,23,"And when David inquired of Jehovah, he said, Thou shalt not go up: make a circuit behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees."
10,5,24,"And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then is Jehovah gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines."
10,5,25,"And David did so, as Jehovah commanded him, and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gezer."
10,6,1,"And David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand."
10,6,2,"And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him, from Baale-judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, which is called by the Name, even the name of Jehovah of hosts that sitteth `above' the cherubim."
10,6,3,"And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart."
10,6,4,"And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill, with the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark."
10,6,5,"And David and all the house of Israel played before Jehovah with all manner of `instruments made of' fir-wood, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with castanets, and with cymbals."
10,6,6,"And when they came to the threshing-floor of Nacon, Uzzah put forth `his hand' to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen stumbled."
10,6,7,"And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God."
10,6,8,"And David was displeased, because Jehovah had broken forth upon Uzzah; and he called that place Perez-uzzah, unto this day."
10,6,9,"And David was afraid of Jehovah that day; and he said, How shall the ark of Jehovah come unto me?"
10,6,10,"So David would not remove the ark of Jehovah unto him into the city of David; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite."
10,6,11,"And the ark of Jehovah remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months: and Jehovah blessed Obed-edom, and all his house."
10,6,12,"And it was told king David, saying, Jehovah hath blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. And David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with joy."
10,6,13,"And it was so, that, when they that bare the ark of Jehovah had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling."
10,6,14,"And David danced before Jehovah with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod."
10,6,15,"So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Jehovah with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet."
10,6,16,"And it was so, as the ark of Jehovah came into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before Jehovah; and she despised him in her heart."
10,6,17,"And they brought in the ark of Jehovah, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Jehovah."
10,6,18,"And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah of hosts."
10,6,19,"And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to every one a cake of bread, and a portion `of flesh', and a cake of raisins. So all the people departed every one to his house."
10,6,20,"Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to-day, who uncovered himself to-day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!"
10,6,21,"And David said unto Michal, `It was' before Jehovah, who chose me above thy father, and above all his house, to appoint me prince over the people of Jehovah, over Israel: therefore will I play before Jehovah."
10,6,22,"And I will be yet more vile than this, and will be base in mine own sight: but of the handmaids of whom thou hast spoken, of them shall I be had in honor."
10,6,23,"And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death."
10,7,1,"And it came to pass, when the king dwelt in his house, and Jehovah had given him rest from all his enemies round about,"
10,7,2,"that the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains."
10,7,3,"And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thy heart; for Jehovah is with thee."
10,7,4,"And it came to pass the same night, that the word of Jehovah came unto Nathan, saying,"
10,7,5,"Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah, Shalt thou build me a house for me to dwell in?"
10,7,6,"for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle."
10,7,7,"In all places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel, spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar?"
10,7,8,"Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over my people, over Israel;"
10,7,9,"and I have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a great name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth."
10,7,10,"And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first,"
10,7,11,"and `as' from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will cause thee to rest from all thine enemies. Moreover Jehovah telleth thee that Jehovah will make thee a house."
10,7,12,"When thy days are fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, that shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom."
10,7,13,"He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever."
10,7,14,"I will be his father, and he shall be my son: if he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men;"
10,7,15,"but my lovingkindness shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee."
10,7,16,"And thy house and thy kingdom shall be made sure for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever."
10,7,17,"According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David."
10,7,18,"Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Lord Jehovah, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far?"
10,7,19,"And this was yet a small thing in thine eyes, O Lord Jehovah; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come; and this `too' after the manner of men, O Lord Jehovah!"
10,7,20,"And what can David say more unto thee? for thou knowest thy servant, O Lord Jehovah."
10,7,21,"For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to make thy servant know it."
10,7,22,"Wherefore thou art great, O Jehovah God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears."
10,7,23,"And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, and to make him a name, and to do great things for you, and terrible things for thy land, before thy people, whom thou redeemest to thee out of Egypt, `from' the nations and their gods?"
10,7,24,"And thou didst establish to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever; and thou, Jehovah, becamest their God."
10,7,25,"And now, O Jehovah God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, confirm thou it for ever, and do as thou hast spoken."
10,7,26,"And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is God over Israel; and the house of thy servant David shall be established before thee."
10,7,27,"For thou, O Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee."
10,7,28,"And now, O Lord Jehovah, thou art God, and thy words are truth, and thou hast promised this good thing unto thy servant:"
10,7,29,"now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee; for thou, O Lord Jehovah, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever."
10,8,1,"And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took the bridle of the mother city out of the hand of the Philistines."
10,8,2,"And he smote Moab, and measured them with the line, making them to lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive. And the Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute."
10,8,3,"David smote also Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his dominion at the River."
10,8,4,"And David took from him a thousand and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David hocked all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for a hundred chariots."
10,8,5,"And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadadezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men."
10,8,6,"Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went."
10,8,7,"And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem."
10,8,8,"And from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass."
10,8,9,"And when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,"
10,8,10,"then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And `Joram' brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:"
10,8,11,"These also did king David dedicate unto Jehovah, with the silver and gold that he dedicated of all the nations which he subdued;"
10,8,12,"of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah."
10,8,13,"And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting the Syrians in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen thousand men."
10,8,14,"And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went."
10,8,15,"And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed justice and righteousness unto all his people."
10,8,16,"And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;"
10,8,17,"and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Seraiah was scribe;"
10,8,18,"and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada `was over' the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief ministers."
10,9,1,"And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?"
10,9,2,"And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him unto David; and the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he."
10,9,3,"And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, who is lame of his feet."
10,9,4,"And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar."
10,9,5,"Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar."
10,9,6,"And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came unto David, and fell on his face, and did obeisance. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold, thy servant!"
10,9,7,"And David said unto him, Fear not; for I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually."
10,9,8,"And he did obeisance, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?"
10,9,9,"Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given unto thy master's son."
10,9,10,"And thou shalt till the land for him, thou, and thy sons, and thy servants; and thou shalt bring in `the fruits', that thy master's son may have bread to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants."
10,9,11,"Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king commandeth his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, `said the king', he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons."
10,9,12,"And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth."
10,9,13,"So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem; for he did eat continually at the king's table. And he was lame in both his feet."
10,10,1,"And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead."
10,10,2,"And David said, I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness unto me. So David sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon."
10,10,3,"But the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, in that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David sent his servants unto thee to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?"
10,10,4,"So Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away."
10,10,5,"When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return."
10,10,6,"And when the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with a thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men."
10,10,7,"And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men."
10,10,8,"And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate: and the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field."
10,10,9,"Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:"
10,10,10,"And the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and he put them in array against the children of Ammon."
10,10,11,"And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me; but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee."
10,10,12,"Be of good courage, and let us play the man for ou people, and for the cities of our God: and Jehovah do that which seemeth him good."
10,10,13,"So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him."
10,10,14,"And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. Then Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem."
10,10,15,"And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they gathered themselves together."
10,10,16,"And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the River: and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer at their head."
10,10,17,"And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him."
10,10,18,"And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians `the men of' seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, so that he died there."
10,10,19,"And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more."
10,11,1,"And it came to pass, at the return of the year, at the time when kings go out `to battle', that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem."
10,11,2,"And it came to pass at eventide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon."
10,11,3,"And David send and inquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?"
10,11,4,"And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness); and she returned unto her house."
10,11,5,"And the woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, I am with child."
10,11,6,"And David sent to Joab, `saying', Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David."
10,11,7,"And when Uriah was come unto him, David asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered."
10,11,8,"And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess `of food' from the king."
10,11,9,"But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house."
10,11,10,"And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Art thou not come from a journey? wherefore didst thou not go down unto thy house?"
10,11,11,"And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in booths; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing."
10,11,12,"And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to-day also, and to-morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow."
10,11,13,"And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house."
10,11,14,"And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah."
10,11,15,"And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die."
10,11,16,"And it came to pass, when Joab kept watch upon the city, that he assigned Uriah unto the place where he knew that valiant men were."
10,11,17,"And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people, even of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also."
10,11,18,"Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;"
10,11,19,"and he charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling all the things concerning the war unto the king,"
10,11,20,"it shall be that, if the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore went ye so nigh unto the city to fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?"
10,11,21,"who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast an upper millstone upon him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? why went ye so nigh the wall? then shalt thou say, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also."
10,11,22,"So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for."
10,11,23,"And the messenger said unto David, The men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entrance of the gate."
10,11,24,"And the shooters shot at thy servants from off the wall; and some of the king's servants are dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also."
10,11,25,"Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another; make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him."
10,11,26,"And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband."
10,11,27,"And when the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased Jehovah."
10,12,1,"And Jehovah sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor."
10,12,2,"The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds;"
10,12,3,"but the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own morsel, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter."
10,12,4,"And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him, but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him."
10,12,5,"And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As Jehovah liveth, the man that hath done this is worthy to die:"
10,12,6,"and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity."
10,12,7,"And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;"
10,12,8,"and I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would have added unto thee such and such things."
10,12,9,"Wherefore hast thou despised the word of Jehovah, to do that which is evil in his sight? thou hast smitten Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon."
10,12,10,"Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house, because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife."
10,12,11,"Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house; and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun."
10,12,12,"For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun."
10,12,13,"And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against Jehovah. And Nathan said unto David, Jehovah also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die."
10,12,14,"Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of Jehovah to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die."
10,12,15,"And Nathan departed unto his house. And Jehovah struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick."
10,12,16,"David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth."
10,12,17,"And the elders of his house arose, `and stood' beside him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them."
10,12,18,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he hearkened not unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead!"
10,12,19,"But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead."
10,12,20,"Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel; and he came into the house of Jehovah, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat."
10,12,21,"Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread."
10,12,22,"And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who knoweth whether Jehovah will not be gracious to me, that the child may live?"
10,12,23,"But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me."
10,12,24,"And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon. And Jehovah loved him;"
10,12,25,"and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, for Jehovah's sake."
10,12,26,"Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city."
10,12,27,"And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah; yea, I have taken the city of waters."
10,12,28,"Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called after my name."
10,12,29,"And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it."
10,12,30,"And he took the crown of their king from off his head; and the weight thereof was a talent of gold, and `in it were' precious stones; and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much."
10,12,31,"And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem."
10,13,1,"And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her."
10,13,2,"And Amnon was so vexed that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything unto her."
10,13,3,"But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man."
10,13,4,"And he said unto him, Why, O son of the king, art thou thus lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister."
10,13,5,"And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and feign thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand."
10,13,6,"So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, Let her sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand."
10,13,7,"Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him food."
10,13,8,"So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes."
10,13,9,"And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him."
10,13,10,"And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from thy hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother."
10,13,11,"And when she had brought them near unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come, lie with me, my sister."
10,13,12,"And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly."
10,13,13,"And I, whither shall I carry my shame? and as for thee, thou wilt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee."
10,13,14,"Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her."
10,13,15,"Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone."
10,13,16,"And she said unto him, Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is `worse' than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her."
10,13,17,"Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her."
10,13,18,"And she had a garment of divers colors upon her; for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her."
10,13,19,"And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went."
10,13,20,"And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but now hold thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; take not this thing to heart. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house."
10,13,21,"But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth."
10,13,22,"And Absalom spake unto Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar."
10,13,23,"And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons."
10,13,24,"And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheep-shearers; let the king, I pray thee, and his servants go with thy servant."
10,13,25,"And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him."
10,13,26,"Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?"
10,13,27,"But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him."
10,13,28,"And Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now, when Amnon's heart is merry with wine; and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon, then kill him; fear not; have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant."
10,13,29,"And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled."
10,13,30,"And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left."
10,13,31,"Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent."
10,13,32,"And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar."
10,13,33,"Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead."
10,13,34,"But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill-side behind him."
10,13,35,"And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons are come: as thy servant said, so it is."
10,13,36,"And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore."
10,13,37,"But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. And `David' mourned for his son every day."
10,13,38,"So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years."
10,13,39,"And `the soul of' king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead."
10,14,1,"Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom."
10,14,2,"And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel, I pray thee, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that hath a long time mourned for the dead:"
10,14,3,"and go in to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth."
10,14,4,"And when the woman of Tekoa spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king."
10,14,5,"And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, Of a truth I am a widow, and my husband is dead."
10,14,6,"And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and killed him."
10,14,7,"And, behold, the whole family is risen against thy handmaid, and they say, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew, and so destroy the heir also. Thus will they quench my coal which is left, and will leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the face of the earth."
10,14,8,"And the king said unto the woman, Go to thy house, and I will give charge concerning thee."
10,14,9,"And the woman of Tekoa said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house; and the king and his throne be guiltless."
10,14,10,"And the king said, Whosoever saith aught unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more."
10,14,11,"Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember Jehovah thy God, that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth."
10,14,12,"Then the woman said, Let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak a word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on."
10,14,13,"And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou devised such a thing against the people of God? for in speaking this word the king is as one that is guilty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished one."
10,14,14,"For we must needs die, and are as water split on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God take away life, but deviseth means, that he that is banished be not an outcast from him."
10,14,15,"Now therefore seeing that I am come to speak this word unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant."
10,14,16,"For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God."
10,14,17,"Then thy handmaid said, Let, I pray thee, the word of my lord the king be comfortable; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: and Jehovah thy God be with thee."
10,14,18,"Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, aught that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak."
10,14,19,"And the king said, Is the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken; for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thy handmaid;"
10,14,20,"to change the face of the matter hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth."
10,14,21,"And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back."
10,14,22,"And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and did obeisance, and blessed the king: and Joab said, To-day thy servant knoweth that I have found favor in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath performed the request of his servant."
10,14,23,"So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem."
10,14,24,"And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, but let him not see my face. So Absalom turned to his own house, and saw not the king's face."
10,14,25,"Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him."
10,14,26,"And when he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year's end that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it); he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king's weight."
10,14,27,"And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance."
10,14,28,"And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem; and he saw not the king's face."
10,14,29,"Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him: and he sent again a second time, but he would not come."
10,14,30,"Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire."
10,14,31,"Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?"
10,14,32,"And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it were better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be iniquity in me, let him kill me."
10,14,33,"So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom."
10,15,1,"And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him."
10,15,2,"And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that, when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel."
10,15,3,"And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee."
10,15,4,"Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!"
10,15,5,"And it was so, that, when any man came nigh to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him."
10,15,6,"And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel."
10,15,7,"And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto Jehovah, in Hebron."
10,15,8,"For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If Jehovah shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem, then I will serve Jehovah."
10,15,9,"And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron."
10,15,10,"But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom is king in Hebron."
10,15,11,"And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they knew not anything."
10,15,12,"And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom."
10,15,13,"And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom."
10,15,14,"And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for else none of us shall escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword."
10,15,15,"And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall choose."
10,15,16,"And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, that were concubines, to keep the house."
10,15,17,"And the king went forth, and all the people after him; and they tarried in Beth-merhak."
10,15,18,"And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men that came after him from Gath, passed on before the king."
10,15,19,"Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return, and abide with the king: for thou art a foreigner, and also an exile; `return' to thine own place."
10,15,20,"Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us, seeing I go whither I may? return thou, and take back thy brethren; mercy and truth be with thee."
10,15,21,"And Ittai answered the king, and said, As Jehovah liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, even there also will thy servant be."
10,15,22,"And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him."
10,15,23,"And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness."
10,15,24,"And, lo, Zadok also `came', and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city."
10,15,25,"And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favor in the eyes of Jehovah, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:"
10,15,26,"but if he say thus, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him."
10,15,27,"The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art thou `not' a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar."
10,15,28,"See, I will tarry at the fords of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me."
10,15,29,"Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they abode there."
10,15,30,"And David went up by the ascent of the `mount of' Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot: and all the people that were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up."
10,15,31,"And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O Jehovah, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness."
10,15,32,"And it came to pass, that, when David was come to the top `of the ascent', where God was worshipped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head."
10,15,33,"And David said unto him, If thou passest on with me, then thou wilt be a burden unto me:"
10,15,34,"but if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant in time past, so will I now be thy servant; then wilt thou defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel."
10,15,35,"And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests."
10,15,36,"Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send unto me everything that ye shall hear."
10,15,37,"So Hushai, David's friend, came into the city; and Absalom came into Jerusalem."
10,16,1,"And when David was a little past the top `of the ascent', behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine."
10,16,2,"And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses are for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink."
10,16,3,"And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem; for he said, To-day will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father."
10,16,4,"Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine is all that pertaineth unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I do obeisance; let me find favor in thy sight, my lord, O king."
10,16,5,"And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and cursed still as he came."
10,16,6,"And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left."
10,16,7,"And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow:"
10,16,8,"Jehovah hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and Jehovah hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and, behold, thou art `taken' in thine own mischief, because thou art a man of blood."
10,16,9,"Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head."
10,16,10,"And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? Because he curseth, and because Jehovah hath said unto him, Curse David; who then shall say, Wherefore hast thou done so?"
10,16,11,"And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more `may' this Benjamite now `do it'? let him alone, and let him curse; for Jehovah hath bidden him."
10,16,12,"It may be that Jehovah will look on the wrong done unto me, and that Jehovah will requite me good for `his' cursing of me this day."
10,16,13,"So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hill-side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust."
10,16,14,"And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there."
10,16,15,"And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him."
10,16,16,"And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, `Long' live the king, `Long' live the king."
10,16,17,"And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?"
10,16,18,"And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom Jehovah, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I abide."
10,16,19,"And again, whom should I serve? `should I' not `serve' in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence."
10,16,20,"Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what we shall do."
10,16,21,"And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, that he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then will the hands of all that are with thee be strong."
10,16,22,"So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel."
10,16,23,"And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom."
10,17,1,"Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:"
10,17,2,"and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed, and will make him afraid; and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only;"
10,17,3,"and I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: `so' all the people shall be in peace."
10,17,4,"And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel."
10,17,5,"Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith."
10,17,6,"And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do `after' his saying? if not, speak thou."
10,17,7,"And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given this time is not good."
10,17,8,"Hushai said moreover, Thou knowest thy father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field; and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people."
10,17,9,"Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some `other' place: and it will come to pass, when some of them are fallen at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom."
10,17,10,"And even he that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they that are with him are valiant men."
10,17,11,"But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person."
10,17,12,"So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground; and of him and of all the men that are with him we will not leave so much as one."
10,17,13,"Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there."
10,17,14,"And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For Jehovah had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Jehovah might bring evil upon Absalom."
10,17,15,"Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled."
10,17,16,"Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him."
10,17,17,"Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En-rogel; and a maid-servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David: for they might not be seen to come into the city."
10,17,18,"But a lad saw them, and told Absalom: and they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down thither."
10,17,19,"And the woman took and spread the covering over the well's mouth, and strewed bruised grain thereon; and nothing was known."
10,17,20,"And Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house; and they said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They are gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem."
10,17,21,"And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said unto David, Arise ye, and pass quickly over the water; for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you."
10,17,22,"Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over the Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over the Jordan."
10,17,23,"And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home, unto his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father."
10,17,24,"Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him."
10,17,25,"And Absalom set Amasa over the host instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Israelite, that went in to Abigal the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab's mother."
10,17,26,"And Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead."
10,17,27,"And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,"
10,17,28,"brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched `grain', and beans, and lentils, and parched `pulse',"
10,17,29,"and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness."
10,18,1,"And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them."
10,18,2,"And David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also."
10,18,3,"But the people said, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but thou art worth ten thousand of us; therefore now it is better that thou be ready to succor us out of the city."
10,18,4,"And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate-side, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands."
10,18,5,"And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom."
10,18,6,"So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim."
10,18,7,"And the people of Israel were smitten there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men."
10,18,8,"For the battle was there spread over the face of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured."
10,18,9,"And Absalom chanced to meet the servants of David. And Absalom was riding upon his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between heaven and earth; and the mule that was under him went on."
10,18,10,"And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak."
10,18,11,"And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest it, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten `pieces of' silver, and a girdle."
10,18,12,"And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand `pieces of' silver in my hand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the king's son; for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom."
10,18,13,"Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there is no matter hid from the king), then thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against `me'."
10,18,14,"Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak."
10,18,15,"And ten young men that bare Joab's armor compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him."
10,18,16,"And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held back the people."
10,18,17,"And they took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones: and all Israel fled every one to his tent."
10,18,18,"Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar, which is in the king's dale; for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name; and it is called Absalom's monument, unto this day."
10,18,19,"Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that Jehovah hath avenged him of his enemies."
10,18,20,"And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not be the bearer of tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day; but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead."
10,18,21,"Then said Joab to the Cushite, Go, tell the king what thou hast seen. And the Cushite bowed himself unto Joab, and ran."
10,18,22,"Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But come what may, let me, I pray thee, also run after the Cushite. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou wilt have no reward for the tidings?"
10,18,23,"But come what may, `said he', I will run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite."
10,18,24,"Now David was sitting between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone."
10,18,25,"And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near."
10,18,26,"And the watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold, `another' man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings."
10,18,27,"And the watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings."
10,18,28,"And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king."
10,18,29,"And the king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, even me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was."
10,18,30,"And the king said, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still."
10,18,31,"And, behold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said, Tidings for my lord the king; for Jehovah hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee."
10,18,32,"And the king said unto the Cushite, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And the Cushite answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise up against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is."
10,18,33,"And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!"
10,19,1,"And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom."
10,19,2,"And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people; for the people heard say that day, The king grieveth for his son."
10,19,3,"And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people that are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle."
10,19,4,"And the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!"
10,19,5,"And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, who this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;"
10,19,6,"in that thou lovest them that hate thee, and hatest them that love thee. For thou hast declared this day, that princes and servants are nought unto thee: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well."
10,19,7,"Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants; for I swear by Jehovah, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry a man with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that hath befallen thee from thy youth until now."
10,19,8,"Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting in the gate: and all the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled every man to his tent."
10,19,9,"And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land from Absalom."
10,19,10,"And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?"
10,19,11,"And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, `to bring him' to his house."
10,19,12,"Ye are my brethren, ye are my bone and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?"
10,19,13,"And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab."
10,19,14,"And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as `the heart of' one man; so that they sent unto the king, `saying', Return thou, and all thy servants."
10,19,15,"So the king returned, and came to the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan."
10,19,16,"And Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David."
10,19,17,"And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king."
10,19,18,"And there went over a ferry-boat to bring over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, when he was come over the Jordan."
10,19,19,"And he said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart."
10,19,20,"For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king."
10,19,21,"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed Jehovah's anointed?"
10,19,22,"And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?"
10,19,23,"And the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him."
10,19,24,"And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace."
10,19,25,"And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?"
10,19,26,"And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go with the king; because thy servant is lame."
10,19,27,"And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes."
10,19,28,"For all my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king; yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more unto the king?"
10,19,29,"And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I say, Thou and Ziba divide the land."
10,19,30,"And Mephibosheth said unto the king, yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come in peace unto his own house."
10,19,31,"And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the Jordan."
10,19,32,"Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man."
10,19,33,"And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will sustain thee with me in Jerusalem."
10,19,34,"And Barzillai said unto the king, How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?"
10,19,35,"I am this day fourscore years old: can I discern between good and bad? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?"
10,19,36,"Thy servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?"
10,19,37,"Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold, thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee."
10,19,38,"And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee."
10,19,39,"And all the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over: and the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place."
10,19,40,"So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him: and all the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel."
10,19,41,"And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and brought the king, and his household, over the Jordan, and all David's men with him?"
10,19,42,"And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then are ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all at the king's cost? or hath he given us any gift?"
10,19,43,"And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more `right' in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel."
10,20,1,"And there happened to be there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew the trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel."
10,20,2,"So all the men of Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem."
10,20,3,"And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and provided them with sustenance, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood."
10,20,4,"Then said the king to Amasa, Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and be thou here present."
10,20,5,"So Amasa went to call `the men of' Judah together; but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him."
10,20,6,"And David said to Abishai, Now will Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fortified cities, and escape out of our sight."
10,20,7,"And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri."
10,20,8,"When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. And Joab was girded with his apparel of war that he had put on, and thereon was a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out."
10,20,9,"And Joab said to Amasa, Is it well with thee, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him."
10,20,10,"But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the body, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. And Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri."
10,20,11,"And there stood by him one of Joab's young men, and said, He that favoreth Joab, and he that is for David, let him follow Joab."
10,20,12,"And Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still."
10,20,13,"When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri."
10,20,14,"And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Beth-maacah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him."
10,20,15,"And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart; and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down."
10,20,16,"Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee."
10,20,17,"And he came near unto her; and the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he answered, I am. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thy handmaid. And he answered, I do hear."
10,20,18,"Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask `counsel' at Abel: and so they ended `the matter'."
10,20,19,"I am of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of Jehovah?"
10,20,20,"And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy."
10,20,21,"The matter is not so: but a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David; deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall."
10,20,22,"Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. And he blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king."
10,20,23,"Now Joab was over all the host of Israel; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites;"
10,20,24,"and Adoram was over the men subject to taskwork; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder;"
10,20,25,"and Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;"
10,20,26,"and also Ira the Jairite was chief minister unto David."
10,21,1,"And there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David sought the face of Jehovah. And Jehovah said, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he put to death the Gibeonites."
10,21,2,"And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah);"
10,21,3,"and David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of Jehovah?"
10,21,4,"And the Gibeonites said unto him, It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you."
10,21,5,"And they said unto the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us, `that' we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel,"
10,21,6,"let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto Jehovah in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of Jehovah. And the king said, I will give them."
10,21,7,"But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of Jehovah's oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul."
10,21,8,"But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bare to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:"
10,21,9,"And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the mountain before Jehovah, and they fell `all' seven together. And they were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest."
10,21,10,"And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water was poured upon them from heaven; and she suffered neither the birds of the heavens to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night."
10,21,11,"And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done."
10,21,12,"And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the street of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, in the day that the Philistines slew Saul in Gilboa;"
10,21,13,"and he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son: and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged."
10,21,14,"And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land."
10,21,15,"And the Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines. And David waxed faint;"
10,21,16,"and Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred `shekels' of brass in weight, he being girded with a new `sword', thought to have slain David."
10,21,17,"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succored him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the lamp of Israel."
10,21,18,"And it came to pass after this, that there was again war with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Saph, who was of the sons of the giant."
10,21,19,"And there was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim the Beth-lehemite slew Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam."
10,21,20,"And there was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant."
10,21,21,"And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David's brother, slew him."
10,21,22,"These four were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants."
10,22,1,"And David spake unto Jehovah the words of this song in the day that Jehovah delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:"
10,22,2,"and he said, Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer, even mine;"
10,22,3,"God, my rock, in him will I take refuge; My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge; My saviour, thou savest me from violence."
10,22,4,"I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised: So shall I be saved from mine enemies."
10,22,5,"For the waves of death compassed me; The floods of ungodliness made me afraid:"
10,22,6,"The cords of Sheol were round about me; The snares of death came upon me."
10,22,7,"In my distress I called upon Jehovah; Yea, I called unto my God: And he heard my voice out of his temple, And my cry `came' into his ears."
10,22,8,"Then the earth shook and trembled, The foundations of heaven quaked And were shaken, because he was wroth."
10,22,9,"There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, And fire out of his mouth devoured: Coals were kindled by it."
10,22,10,"He bowed the heavens also, and came down; And thick darkness was under his feet."
10,22,11,"And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; Yea, he was seen upon the wings of the wind."
10,22,12,"And he made darkness pavilions round about him, Gathering of waters, thick clouds of the skies."
10,22,13,"At the brightness before him Coals of fire were kindled."
10,22,14,"Jehovah thundered from heaven, And the Most High uttered his voice."
10,22,15,"And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; Lightning, and discomfited them."
10,22,16,"Then the channels of the sea appeared, The foundations of the world were laid bare, By the rebuke of Jehovah, At the blast of the breath of his nostrils."
10,22,17,"He sent from on high, he took me; He drew me out of many waters;"
10,22,18,"He delivered me from my strong enemy, From them that hated me; for they were too mighty for me."
10,22,19,"They came upon me in the day of my calamity; But Jehovah was my stay."
10,22,20,"He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because he delighted in me."
10,22,21,"Jehovah rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me."
10,22,22,"For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, And have not wickedly departed from my God."
10,22,23,"For all his ordinances were before me; And as for his statutes, I did not depart from them."
10,22,24,"I was also perfect toward him; And I kept myself from mine iniquity."
10,22,25,"Therefore hath Jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to my cleanness in his eyesight."
10,22,26,"With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; With the perfect man thou wilt show thyself perfect;"
10,22,27,"With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; And with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward."
10,22,28,"And the afflicted people thou wilt save; But thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down."
10,22,29,"For thou art my lamp, O Jehovah; And Jehovah will lighten my darkness."
10,22,30,"For by thee I run upon a troop; By my God do I leap over a wall."
10,22,31,"As for God, his way is perfect: The word of Jehovah is tried; He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in him."
10,22,32,"For who is God, save Jehovah? And who is a rock, save our God?"
10,22,33,"God is my strong fortress; And he guideth the perfect in his way."
10,22,34,"He maketh his feet like hinds' `feet', And setteth me upon my high places."
10,22,35,"He teacheth my hands to war, So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass."
10,22,36,"Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation; And thy gentleness hath made me great."
10,22,37,"Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; And my feet have not slipped."
10,22,38,"I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; Neither did I turn again till they were consumed."
10,22,39,"And I have consumed them, and smitten them through, so that they cannot arise: Yea, they are fallen under my feet."
10,22,40,"For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle; Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me."
10,22,41,"Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me, That I might cut off them that hate me."
10,22,42,"They looked, but there was none to save; Even unto Jehovah, but he answered them not."
10,22,43,"Then did I beat them small as the dust of the earth, I did crush them as the mire of the streets, and did spread them abroad."
10,22,44,"Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people; Thou hast kept me to be the head of the nations: A people whom I have not known shall serve me."
10,22,45,"The foreigners shall submit themselves unto me: As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me."
10,22,46,"The foreigners shall fade away, And shall come trembling out of their close places."
10,22,47,"Jehovah liveth; And blessed be my rock; And exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,"
10,22,48,"Even the God that executeth vengeance for me, And that bringeth down peoples under me,"
10,22,49,"And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: Yea, thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me; Thou deliverest me from the violent man."
10,22,50,"Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among the nations, And will sing praises unto thy name."
10,22,51,"Great deliverance giveth he to his king, And showeth lovingkindness to his anointed, To David and to his seed, for evermore."
10,23,1,"Now these are the last words of David. David the son of Jesse saith, And the man who was raised on high saith, The anointed of the God of Jacob, And the sweet psalmist of Israel:"
10,23,2,"The Spirit of Jehovah spake by me, And his word was upon my tongue."
10,23,3,"The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spake to me: One that ruleth over men righteously, That ruleth in the fear of God,"
10,23,4,"`He shall be' as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, A morning without clouds, `When' the tender grass `springeth' out of the earth, Through clear shining after rain."
10,23,5,"Verily my house is not so with God; Yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, Ordered in all things, and sure: For it is all my salvation, and all `my' desire, Although he maketh it not to grow."
10,23,6,"But the ungodly shall be all of them as thorns to be thrust away, Because they cannot be taken with the hand;"
10,23,7,"But the man that toucheth them Must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear: And they shall be utterly burned with fire in `their' place."
10,23,8,"These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite, against eight hundred slain at one time."
10,23,9,"And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away."
10,23,10,"He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword; and Jehovah wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to take spoil."
10,23,11,"And after him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from the Philistines."
10,23,12,"But he stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and Jehovah wrought a great victory."
10,23,13,"And three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim."
10,23,14,"And David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem."
10,23,15,"And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate!"
10,23,16,"And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto Jehovah."
10,23,17,"And he said, Be it far from me, O Jehovah, that I should do this: `shall I drink' the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men."
10,23,18,"And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them, and had a name among the three."
10,23,19,"Was he not most honorable of the three? therefore he was made their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the `first' three."
10,23,20,"And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he slew the two `sons of' Ariel of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow."
10,23,21,"And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear."
10,23,22,"These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men."
10,23,23,"He was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to the `first' three. And David set him over his guard."
10,23,24,"Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem,"
10,23,25,"Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,"
10,23,26,"Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,"
10,23,27,"Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,"
10,23,28,"Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,"
10,23,29,"Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,"
10,23,30,"Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash."
10,23,31,"Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,"
10,23,32,"Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,"
10,23,33,"Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite,"
10,23,34,"Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maacathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,"
10,23,35,"Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,"
10,23,36,"Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,"
10,23,37,"Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armorbearers to Joab the son of Zeruiah,"
10,23,38,"Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,"
10,23,39,"Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all."
10,24,1,"And again the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Judah."
10,24,2,"And the king said to Joab the captain of the host, who was with him, Go now to and fro through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the sum of the people."
10,24,3,"And Joab said unto the king, Now Jehovah thy God add unto the people, how many soever they may be, a hundredfold; and may the eyes of my lord the king see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?"
10,24,4,"Notwithstanding, the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel."
10,24,5,"And they passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and unto Jazer:"
10,24,6,"then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and round about to Sidon,"
10,24,7,"and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah, at Beer-sheba."
10,24,8,"So when they had gone to and from through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days."
10,24,9,"And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men."
10,24,10,"And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto Jehovah, I have sinned greatly in that which I have done: but now, O Jehovah, put away, I beseech thee, the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly."
10,24,11,"And when David rose up in the morning, the word of Jehovah came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,"
10,24,12,"Go and speak unto David, Thus saith Jehovah, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee."
10,24,13,"So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thy foes while they pursue thee? or shall there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise thee, and consider what answer I shall return to him that sent me."
10,24,14,"And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of Jehovah; for his mercies are great; and let me not fall into the hand of man."
10,24,15,"So Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men."
10,24,16,"And when the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Jehovah repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough; now stay thy hand. And the angel of Jehovah was by the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite."
10,24,17,"And David spake unto Jehovah when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done perversely; but these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house."
10,24,18,"And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite."
10,24,19,"And David went up according to the saying of Gad, as Jehovah commanded."
10,24,20,"And Araunah looked forth, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground."
10,24,21,"And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing-floor of thee, to build an altar unto Jehovah, that the plague may be stayed from the people."
10,24,22,"And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, the oxen for the burnt-offering, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood:"
10,24,23,"all this, O king, doth Araunah give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, Jehovah thy God accept thee."
10,24,24,"And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will verily buy it of thee at a price. Neither will I offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah my God which cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver."
10,24,25,"And David built there an altar unto Jehovah, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings. So Jehovah was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel."
11,1,1,"Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat."
11,1,2,"Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat."
11,1,3,"So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king."
11,1,4,"And the damsel was very fair; and she cherished the king, and ministered to him; but the king knew her not."
11,1,5,"Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him."
11,1,6,"And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he was also a very goodly man; and he was born after Absalom."
11,1,7,"And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him."
11,1,8,"But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men that belonged to David, were not with Adonijah."
11,1,9,"And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel; and he called all his brethren, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah, the king's servants:"
11,1,10,"but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not."
11,1,11,"Then Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?"
11,1,12,"Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon."
11,1,13,"Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?"
11,1,14,"Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words."
11,1,15,"And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering unto the king."
11,1,16,"And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?"
11,1,17,"And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by Jehovah thy God unto thy handmaid, `saying', Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne."
11,1,18,"And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and thou, my lord the king, knowest it not:"
11,1,19,"and he hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host; but Solomon thy servant hath he not called."
11,1,20,"And thou, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him."
11,1,21,"Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders."
11,1,22,"And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in."
11,1,23,"And they told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground."
11,1,24,"And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?"
11,1,25,"For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and say, `Long' live king Adonijah."
11,1,26,"But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called."
11,1,27,"Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not showed unto thy servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?"
11,1,28,"Then king David answered and said, Call to me Bath-sheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king."
11,1,29,"And the king sware, and said, As Jehovah liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,"
11,1,30,"verily as I sware unto thee by Jehovah, the God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; verily so will I do this day."
11,1,31,"Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did obeisance to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever."
11,1,32,"And king David said, Call to me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king."
11,1,33,"And the king said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:"
11,1,34,"and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel; and blow ye the trumpet, and say, `Long' live king Solomon."
11,1,35,"Then ye shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead; and I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah."
11,1,36,"And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: Jehovah, the God of my lord the king, say so `too'."
11,1,37,"As Jehovah hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David."
11,1,38,"So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon."
11,1,39,"And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, `Long' live king Solomon."
11,1,40,"And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them."
11,1,41,"And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?"
11,1,42,"While he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said, Come in; for thou art a worthy man, and bringest good tidings."
11,1,43,"And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king:"
11,1,44,"and the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule;"
11,1,45,"and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon; and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard."
11,1,46,"And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom."
11,1,47,"And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, Thy God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne: and the king bowed himself upon the bed."
11,1,48,"And also thus said the king, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it."
11,1,49,"And all the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way."
11,1,50,"And Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar."
11,1,51,"And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon; for, lo, he hath laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me first that he will not slay his servant with the sword."
11,1,52,"And Solomon said, If he shall show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth; but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die."
11,1,53,"So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and did obeisance to king Solomon; and Solomon said unto him, Go to thy house."
11,2,1,"Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,"
11,2,2,"I am going the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and show thyself a man;"
11,2,3,"and keep the charge of Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, `and' his commandments, and his ordinances, and his testimonies, according to that which is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself."
11,2,4,"That Jehovah may establish his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel."
11,2,5,"Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did unto me, even what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet."
11,2,6,"Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to Sheol in peace."
11,2,7,"But show kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table; for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom thy brother."
11,2,8,"And, behold, there is with thee Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I sware to him by Jehovah, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword."
11,2,9,"Now therefore hold him not guiltless, for thou art a wise man; and thou wilt know what thou oughtest to do unto him, and thou shalt bring his hoar head down to Sheol with blood."
11,2,10,"And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David."
11,2,11,"And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem."
11,2,12,"And Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly."
11,2,13,"Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably."
11,2,14,"He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on."
11,2,15,"And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's; for it was his from Jehovah."
11,2,16,"And now I ask one petition of thee; deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on."
11,2,17,"And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king (for he will not say thee nay), that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife."
11,2,18,"And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king."
11,2,19,"Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand."
11,2,20,"Then she said, I ask one small petition of thee; deny me not. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother; for I will not deny thee."
11,2,21,"And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife."
11,2,22,"And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah."
11,2,23,"Then king Solomon sware by Jehovah, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah hath not spoken this word against his own life."
11,2,24,"Now therefore as Jehovah liveth, who hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me a house, as he promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death this day."
11,2,25,"And king Solomon sent by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him, so that he died."
11,2,26,"And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord Jehovah before David my father, and because thou wast afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted."
11,2,27,"So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto Jehovah, that he might fulfil the word of Jehovah, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh."
11,2,28,"And the tidings came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the Tent of Jehovah, and caught hold on the horns of the altar."
11,2,29,"And it was told king Solomon, Joab is fled unto the Tent of Jehovah, and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him."
11,2,30,"And Benaiah came to the Tent of Jehovah, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me."
11,2,31,"And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father's house."
11,2,32,"And Jehovah will return his blood upon his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, and my father David knew it not, `to wit', Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah."
11,2,33,"So shall their blood return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but unto David, and unto his seed, and unto his house, and unto his throne, shall there be peace for ever from Jehovah."
11,2,34,"Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness."
11,2,35,"And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host; and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar."
11,2,36,"And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither."
11,2,37,"For on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, know thou for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head."
11,2,38,"And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days."
11,2,39,"And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants are in Gath."
11,2,40,"And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath."
11,2,41,"And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again."
11,2,42,"And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not adjure thee by Jehovah, and protest unto thee, saying, Know for certain, that on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The saying that I have heard is good."
11,2,43,"Why then hast thou not kept the oath of Jehovah, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?"
11,2,44,"The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore Jehovah shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head."
11,2,45,"But king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before Jehovah for ever."
11,2,46,"So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out, and fell upon him, so that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon."
11,3,1,"And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of Jehovah, and the wall of Jerusalem round about."
11,3,2,"Only the people sacrificed in the high places, because there was no house built for the name of Jehovah until those days."
11,3,3,"And Solomon loved Jehovah, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places."
11,3,4,"And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar."
11,3,5,"In Gibeon Jehovah appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, Ask what I shall give thee."
11,3,6,"And Solomon said, Thou hast showed unto thy servant David my father great lovingkindness, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great lovingkindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day."
11,3,7,"And now, O Jehovah my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child; I know not how to go out or come in."
11,3,8,"And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude."
11,3,9,"Give thy servant therefore an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this thy great people?"
11,3,10,"And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing."
11,3,11,"And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life, neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies, but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern justice;"
11,3,12,"behold, I have done according to thy word: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there hath been none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee."
11,3,13,"And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches and honor, so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee, all thy days."
11,3,14,"And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days."
11,3,15,"And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream: and he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and offered up burnt-offerings, and offered peace-offerings, and made a feast to all his servants."
11,3,16,"Then there came two women that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him."
11,3,17,"And the one woman said, Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house."
11,3,18,"And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also; and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house."
11,3,19,"And this woman's child died in the night, because she lay upon it."
11,3,20,"And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thy handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom."
11,3,21,"And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead; but when I had looked at it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, whom I did bear."
11,3,22,"And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the king."
11,3,23,"Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living."
11,3,24,"And the king said, Fetch me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king."
11,3,25,"And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other."
11,3,26,"Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her heart yearned over her son, and she said, Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, It shall be neither mine nor thine; divide it."
11,3,27,"Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof."
11,3,28,"And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do justice."
11,4,1,"And king Solomon was king over all Israel."
11,4,2,"And these were the princes whom he had: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest;"
11,4,3,"Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder;"
11,4,4,"and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;"
11,4,5,"and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; and Zabud the son of Nathan was chief minister, `and' the king's friend;"
11,4,6,"and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the men subject to taskwork."
11,4,7,"And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided victuals for the king and his household: each man had to make provision for a month in the year."
11,4,8,"And these are their names: Ben-hur, in the hill-country of Ephraim;"
11,4,9,"Ben-deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan;"
11,4,10,"Ben-hesed, in Arubboth (to him `pertained' Socoh, and all the land of Hepher);"
11,4,11,"Ben-abinadab, in all the height of Dor (he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife);"
11,4,12,"Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam;"
11,4,13,"Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gilead (to him `pertained' the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; `even' to him `pertained' the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brazen bars);"
11,4,14,"Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;"
11,4,15,"Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon to wife);"
11,4,16,"Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth;"
11,4,17,"Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar;"
11,4,18,"Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin;"
11,4,19,"Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and `he was' the only officer that was in the land."
11,4,20,"Judah and Israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry."
11,4,21,"And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought tribute, and served Solomon all the days of his life."
11,4,22,"And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,"
11,4,23,"ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides harts, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fatted fowl."
11,4,24,"For he had dominion over all `the region' on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the River: and he had peace on all sides round about him."
11,4,25,"And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon."
11,4,26,"And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen."
11,4,27,"And those officers provided victuals for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month; they let nothing be lacking."
11,4,28,"Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they unto the place where `the officers' were, every man according to his charge."
11,4,29,"And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore."
11,4,30,"And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt."
11,4,31,"For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all the nations round about."
11,4,32,"And he spake three thousand proverbs; and his songs were a thousand and five."
11,4,33,"And he spake of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall; he spake also of beasts, and of birds, and of creeping things, and of fishes."
11,4,34,"And there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom."
11,5,1,"And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David."
11,5,2,"And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,"
11,5,3,"Thou knowest how that David my father could not build a house for the name of Jehovah his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until Jehovah put them under the soles of his feet."
11,5,4,"But now Jehovah my God hath given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary, nor evil occurrence."
11,5,5,"And, behold, I purpose to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God, as Jehovah spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build the house for my name."
11,5,6,"Now therefore command thou that they cut me cedar-trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants; and I will give thee hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt say: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that knoweth how to cut timber like unto the Sidonians."
11,5,7,"And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be Jehovah this day, who hath given unto David a wise son over this great people."
11,5,8,"And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have heard `the message' which thou hast sent unto me: I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir."
11,5,9,"My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea; and I will make them into rafts to go by sea unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there, and thou shalt receive them; and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household."
11,5,10,"So Hiram gave Solomon timber of cedar and timber of fir according to all his desire."
11,5,11,"And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year."
11,5,12,"And Jehovah gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together."
11,5,13,"And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men."
11,5,14,"And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses; a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home; and Adoniram was over the men subject to taskwork."
11,5,15,"And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand that were hewers in the mountains;"
11,5,16,"besides Solomon's chief officers that were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who bare rule over the people that wrought in the work."
11,5,17,"And the king commanded, and they hewed out great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with wrought stone."
11,5,18,"And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the Gebalites did fashion them, and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house."
11,6,1,"And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of Jehovah."
11,6,2,"And the house which king Solomon built for Jehovah, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty `cubits', and the height thereof thirty cubits."
11,6,3,"And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; `and' ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house."
11,6,4,"And for the house he made windows of fixed lattice-work."
11,6,5,"And against the wall of the house he built stories round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle; and he made side-chambers round about."
11,6,6,"The nethermost story was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for on the outside he made offsets `in the wall' of the house round about, that `the beams' should not have hold in the walls of the house."
11,6,7,"And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building."
11,6,8,"The door for the middle side-chambers was in the right side of the house: and they went up by winding stairs into the middle `story', and out of the middle into the third."
11,6,9,"So he built the house, and finished it; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar."
11,6,10,"And he built the stories against all the house, each five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar."
11,6,11,"And the word of Jehovah came to Solomon, saying,"
11,6,12,"Concerning this house which thou art building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute mine ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I establish my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father."
11,6,13,"And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel."
11,6,14,"So Solomon built the house, and finished it."
11,6,15,"And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar: from the floor of the house unto the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of fir."
11,6,16,"And he built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor unto the walls `of the ceiling': he built `them' for it within, for an oracle, even for the most holy place."
11,6,17,"And the house, that is, the temple before `the oracle', was forty cubits `long'."
11,6,18,"And there was cedar on the house within, carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen."
11,6,19,"And he prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of Jehovah."
11,6,20,"And within the oracle was `a space of' twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof; and he overlaid it with pure gold: and he covered the altar with cedar."
11,6,21,"So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he drew chains of gold across before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold."
11,6,22,"And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until all the house was finished: also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle he overlaid with gold."
11,6,23,"And in the oracle he made two cherubim of olive-wood, each ten cubits high."
11,6,24,"And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits."
11,6,25,"And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one measure and one form."
11,6,26,"The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub."
11,6,27,"And he set the cherubim within the inner house; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house."
11,6,28,"And he overlaid the cherubim with gold."
11,6,29,"And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, within and without."
11,6,30,"And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without."
11,6,31,"And for the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive-wood: the lintel `and' door-posts were a fifth part `of the wall'."
11,6,32,"So `he made' two doors of olive-wood; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread the gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm-trees."
11,6,33,"So also made he for the entrance of the temple door-posts of olive-wood, out of a fourth part `of the wall';"
11,6,34,"and two doors of fir-wood: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding."
11,6,35,"And he carved `thereon' cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold fitted upon the graven work."
11,6,36,"And he built the inner court with three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams."
11,6,37,"In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of Jehovah laid, in the month Ziv."
11,6,38,"And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it."
11,7,1,"And Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house."
11,7,2,"For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was a hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars."
11,7,3,"And it was covered with cedar above over the forty and five beams, that were upon the pillars; fifteen in a row."
11,7,4,"And there were beams in three rows, and window was over against window in three ranks."
11,7,5,"And all the doors and posts were made square with beams: and window was over against window in three ranks."
11,7,6,"And he made the porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits; and a porch before them; and pillars and a threshold before them."
11,7,7,"And he made the porch of the throne where he was to judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor."
11,7,8,"And his house where he was to dwell, the other court within the porch, was of the like work. He made also a house for Pharaoh's daughter (whom Solomon had taken to wife), like unto this porch."
11,7,9,"All these were of costly stones, even of hewn stone, according to measure, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside unto the great court."
11,7,10,"And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits."
11,7,11,"And above were costly stones, even hewn stone, according to measure, and cedar-wood."
11,7,12,"And the great court round about had three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams; like as the inner court of the house of Jehovah, and the porch of the house."
11,7,13,"And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre."
11,7,14,"He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work."
11,7,15,"For he fashioned the two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits compassed either of them about."
11,7,16,"And he made two capitals of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits."
11,7,17,"There were nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital."
11,7,18,"So he made the pillars; and there were two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars: and so did he for the other capital."
11,7,19,"And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily-work, four cubits."
11,7,20,"And there were capitals above also upon the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows round about upon the other capital."
11,7,21,"And he set up the pillars at the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin; and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz."
11,7,22,"And upon the top of the pillars was lily-work: so was the work of the pillars finished."
11,7,23,"And he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and the height thereof was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about."
11,7,24,"And under the brim of it round about there were knops which did compass it, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about: the knops were in two rows, cast when it was cast."
11,7,25,"It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward."
11,7,26,"And it was a handbreadth thick: and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it held two thousand baths."
11,7,27,"And he made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it."
11,7,28,"And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had panels; and there were panels between the ledges;"
11,7,29,"and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and upon the ledges there was a pedestal above; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work."
11,7,30,"And every base had four brazen wheels, and axles of brass; and the four feet thereof had undersetters: beneath the laver were the undersetters molten, with wreaths at the side of each."
11,7,31,"And the mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: and the mouth thereof was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also upon the mouth of it were gravings, and their panels were foursquare, not round."
11,7,32,"And the four wheels were underneath the panels; and the axletrees of the wheels were in the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit."
11,7,33,"And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their felloes, and their spokes, and their naves, were all molten."
11,7,34,"And there were four undersetters at the four corners of each base: the undersetters thereof were of the base itself."
11,7,35,"And in the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high; and on the top of the base the stays thereof and the panels thereof were of the same."
11,7,36,"And on the plates of the stays thereof, and on the panels thereof, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm-trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths round about."
11,7,37,"After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form."
11,7,38,"And he made ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths; and every laver was four cubits; and upon very one of the ten bases one laver."
11,7,39,"And he set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south."
11,7,40,"And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of Jehovah:"
11,7,41,"the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;"
11,7,42,"and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars;"
11,7,43,"and the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases;"
11,7,44,"and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea;"
11,7,45,"and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: even all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon, in the house of Jehovah, were of burnished brass."
11,7,46,"In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan."
11,7,47,"And Solomon left all the vessels `unweighed', because they were exceeding many: the weight of the brass could not be found out."
11,7,48,"And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Jehovah: the golden altar, and the table whereupon the showbread was, of gold;"
11,7,49,"and the candlesticks, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;"
11,7,50,"and the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the firepans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, `to wit', of the temple, of gold."
11,7,51,"Thus all the work that king Solomon wrought in the house of Jehovah was finished. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated, `even' the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of Jehovah."
11,8,1,"Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers' `houses' of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zion."
11,8,2,"And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month."
11,8,3,"And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark."
11,8,4,"And they brought up the ark of Jehovah, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; even these did the priests and the Levites bring up."
11,8,5,"And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude."
11,8,6,"And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah unto its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim."
11,8,7,"For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above."
11,8,8,"And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place before the oracle; but they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day."
11,8,9,"There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when Jehovah made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt."
11,8,10,"And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Jehovah,"
11,8,11,"so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah."
11,8,12,"Then spake Solomon, Jehovah hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness."
11,8,13,"I have surely built thee a house of habitation, a place for thee to dwell in for ever."
11,8,14,"And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood."
11,8,15,"And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who spake with his mouth unto David thy father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,"
11,8,16,"Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel."
11,8,17,"Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel."
11,8,18,"But Jehovah said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart:"
11,8,19,"nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name."
11,8,20,"And Jehovah hath established his word that he spake; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and have built the house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel."
11,8,21,"And there have I set a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of Jehovah, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt."
11,8,22,"And Solomon stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;"
11,8,23,"and he said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keepest covenant and lovingkindness with thy servants, that walk before thee with all their heart;"
11,8,24,"who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him: yea, thou spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day."
11,8,25,"Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me as thou hast walked before me."
11,8,26,"Now therefore, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father."
11,8,27,"But will God in very deed dwell on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded!"
11,8,28,"Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee this day;"
11,8,29,"that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place whereof thou hast said, My name shall be there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place."
11,8,30,"And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: yea, hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place; and when thou hearest, forgive."
11,8,31,"If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and he come `and' swear before thine altar in this house;"
11,8,32,"then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head, and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness."
11,8,33,"When thy people Israel are smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; if they turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication unto thee in this house:"
11,8,34,"then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers."
11,8,35,"When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them:"
11,8,36,"then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance."
11,8,37,"If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting `or' mildew, locust `or' caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be;"
11,8,38,"what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, `or' by all thy people Israel, who shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:"
11,8,39,"then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and do, and render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)"
11,8,40,"that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers."
11,8,41,"Moreover concerning the foreigner, that is not of thy people Israel, when he shall come out of a far country for thy name's sake;"
11,8,42,"(for they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy mighty hand, and of thine outstretched arm); when he shall come and pray toward this house;"
11,8,43,"hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the foreigner calleth to thee for; that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by my name."
11,8,44,"If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatsoever way thou shalt send them, and they pray unto Jehovah toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name;"
11,8,45,"then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause."
11,8,46,"If they sin against thee (for there is no man that sinneth not), and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive unto the land of the enemy, far off or near;"
11,8,47,"yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captive, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have dealt wickedly;"
11,8,48,"if they return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name:"
11,8,49,"then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling-place, and maintain their cause;"
11,8,50,"and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee; and give them compassion before those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them;"
11,8,51,"(for they are thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron);"
11,8,52,"that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them whensoever they cry unto thee."
11,8,53,"For thou didst separate them from among all the peoples of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord Jehovah."
11,8,54,"And it was so, that, when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto Jehovah, he arose from before the altar of Jehovah, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven."
11,8,55,"And he stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying,"
11,8,56,"Blessed be Jehovah, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by Moses his servant."
11,8,57,"Jehovah our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us;"
11,8,58,"that he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his ordinances, which he commanded our fathers."
11,8,59,"And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before Jehovah, be nigh unto Jehovah our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel, as every day shall require;"
11,8,60,"that all the peoples of the earth may know that Jehovah, he is God; there is none else."
11,8,61,"Let your heart therefore be perfect with Jehovah our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day."
11,8,62,"And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before Jehovah."
11,8,63,"And Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he offered unto Jehovah, two and twenty thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Jehovah."
11,8,64,"The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah; for there he offered the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar that was before Jehovah was too little to receive the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings."
11,8,65,"So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt, before Jehovah our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days."
11,8,66,"On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that Jehovah had showed unto David his servant, and to Israel his people."
11,9,1,"And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of Jehovah, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do,"
11,9,2,"that Jehovah appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon."
11,9,3,"And Jehovah said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually."
11,9,4,"And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and mine ordinances;"
11,9,5,"then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom over Israel for ever, according as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel."
11,9,6,"But if ye shall turn away from following me, ye or your children, and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;"
11,9,7,"then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples."
11,9,8,"And though this house is so high, yet shall every one that passeth by it be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath Jehovah done thus unto this land, and to this house?"
11,9,9,"and they shall answer, Because they forsook Jehovah their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath Jehovah brought all this evil upon them."
11,9,10,"And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the two houses, the house of Jehovah and the king's house,"
11,9,11,"(now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar-trees and fir-trees, and with gold, according to all his desire), that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee."
11,9,12,"And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not."
11,9,13,"And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day."
11,9,14,"And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold."
11,9,15,"And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised, to build the house of Jehovah, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer."
11,9,16,"Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a portion unto his daughter, Solomon's wife."
11,9,17,"And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether,"
11,9,18,"and Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land,"
11,9,19,"and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion."
11,9,20,"As for all the people that were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel;"
11,9,21,"their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy, of them did Solomon raise a levy of bondservants unto this day."
11,9,22,"But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondservants; but they were the men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen."
11,9,23,"These were the chief officers that were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, who bare rule over the people that wrought in the work."
11,9,24,"But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which `Solomon' had built for her: then did he build Millo."
11,9,25,"And three times a year did Solomon offer burnt-offerings and peace-offerings upon the altar which he built unto Jehovah, burning incense therewith, `upon the altar' that was before Jehovah. So he finished the house."
11,9,26,"And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom."
11,9,27,"And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon."
11,9,28,"And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon."
11,10,1,"And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of Jehovah, she came to prove him with hard questions."
11,10,2,"And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones; and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart."
11,10,3,"And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not anything hid from the king which he told her not."
11,10,4,"And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,"
11,10,5,"and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of Jehovah; there was no more spirit in her."
11,10,6,"And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom."
11,10,7,"Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me; thy wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard."
11,10,8,"Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, that stand continually before thee, `and' that hear thy wisdom."
11,10,9,"Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because Jehovah loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do justice and righteousness."
11,10,10,"And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon."
11,10,11,"And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug-trees and precious stones."
11,10,12,"And the king made of the almug-trees pillars for the house of Jehovah, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for the singers: there came no such almug-trees, nor were seen, unto this day."
11,10,13,"And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, besides that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants."
11,10,14,"Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,"
11,10,15,"besides `that which' the traders `brought', and the traffic of the merchants, and of all the kings of the mingled people, and of the governors of the country."
11,10,16,"And king Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred `shekels' of gold went to one buckler."
11,10,17,"And `he made' three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pounds of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon."
11,10,18,"Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold."
11,10,19,"There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays."
11,10,20,"And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom."
11,10,21,"And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon."
11,10,22,"For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram: once every three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks."
11,10,23,"So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom."
11,10,24,"And all the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart."
11,10,25,"And they brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year."
11,10,26,"And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem."
11,10,27,"And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance."
11,10,28,"And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; and the king's merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price."
11,10,29,"And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred `shekels' of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means."
11,11,1,"Now king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites;"
11,11,2,"of the nations concerning which Jehovah said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go among them, neither shall they come among you; for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love."
11,11,3,"And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart."
11,11,4,"For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God, as was the heart of David his father."
11,11,5,"For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites."
11,11,6,"And Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and went not fully after Jehovah, as did David his father."
11,11,7,"Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, in the mount that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon."
11,11,8,"And so did he for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods."
11,11,9,"And Jehovah was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away from Jehovah, the God of Israel, who had appeared unto him twice,"
11,11,10,"and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which Jehovah commanded."
11,11,11,"Wherefore Jehovah said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant."
11,11,12,"Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it, for David thy father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son."
11,11,13,"Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to thy son, for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen."
11,11,14,"And Jehovah raised up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom."
11,11,15,"For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, and had smitten every male in Edom;"
11,11,16,"(for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom);"
11,11,17,"that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt, Hadad being yet a little child."
11,11,18,"And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land."
11,11,19,"And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen."
11,11,20,"And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh's house among the sons of Pharaoh."
11,11,21,"And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country."
11,11,22,"Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit only let me depart."
11,11,23,"And God raised up `another' adversary unto him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah."
11,11,24,"And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a troop, when David slew them `of Zobah': and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus."
11,11,25,"And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief that Hadad `did': and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria."
11,11,26,"And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king."
11,11,27,"And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of David his father."
11,11,28,"And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge over all the labor of the house of Joseph."
11,11,29,"And it came to pass at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; now `Ahijah' had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field."
11,11,30,"And Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces."
11,11,31,"And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces; for thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee;"
11,11,32,"(but he shall have one tribe, for my servant David's sake and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel);"
11,11,33,"because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon; and they have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and `to keep' my statutes and mine ordinances, as did David his father."
11,11,34,"Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant's sake whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes;"
11,11,35,"but I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes."
11,11,36,"And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a lamp alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there."
11,11,37,"And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel."
11,11,38,"And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that which is right in mine eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and will build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee."
11,11,39,"And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever."
11,11,40,"Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon."
11,11,41,"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?"
11,11,42,"And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years."
11,11,43,"And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead."
11,12,1,"And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king."
11,12,2,"And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was yet in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt,"
11,12,3,"and they sent and called him), that Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,"
11,12,4,"Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee."
11,12,5,"And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed."
11,12,6,"And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?"
11,12,7,"And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever."
11,12,8,"But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him, that stood before him."
11,12,9,"And he said unto them, What counsel give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter?"
11,12,10,"And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou say unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou speak unto them, My little finger is thicker than my father's loins."
11,12,11,"And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions."
11,12,12,"So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day."
11,12,13,"And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him,"
11,12,14,"and spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions."
11,12,15,"So the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was a thing brought about of Jehovah, that he might establish his word, which Jehovah spake by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat."
11,12,16,"And when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents."
11,12,17,"But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them."
11,12,18,"Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the men subject to taskwork; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. And king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem."
11,12,19,"So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day."
11,12,20,"And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only."
11,12,21,"And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, that were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon."
11,12,22,"But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,"
11,12,23,"Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying,"
11,12,24,"Thus saith Jehovah, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is of me. So they hearkened unto the word of Jehovah, and returned and went their way, according to the word of Jehovah."
11,12,25,"Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and he went out from thence, and built Penuel."
11,12,26,"And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now will the kingdom return to the house of David:"
11,12,27,"if this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, then will the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah; and they will kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah."
11,12,28,"Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold; and he said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt."
11,12,29,"And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other put he in Dan."
11,12,30,"And this thing became a sin; for the people went `to worship' before the one, even unto Dan."
11,12,31,"And he made houses of high places, and made priests from among all the people, that were not of the sons of Levi."
11,12,32,"And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he went up unto the altar; so did he in Beth-el, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Beth-el the priests of the high places that he had made."
11,12,33,"And he went up unto the altar which he had made in Beth-el on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart: and he ordained a feast for the children of Israel, and went up unto the altar, to burn incense."
11,13,1,"And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of Jehovah unto Beth-el: and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense."
11,13,2,"And he cried against the altar by the word of Jehovah, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith Jehovah: Behold, a son shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he sacrifice the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall they burn upon thee."
11,13,3,"And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which Jehovah hath spoken: Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out."
11,13,4,"And it came to pass, when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Beth-el, that Jeroboam put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back again to him."
11,13,5,"The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of Jehovah."
11,13,6,"And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Entreat now the favor of Jehovah thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God entreated Jehovah, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as it was before."
11,13,7,"And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward."
11,13,8,"And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thy house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place;"
11,13,9,"for so was it charged me by the word of Jehovah, saying, Thou shalt eat no bread, nor drink water, neither return by the way that thou camest."
11,13,10,"So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Beth-el."
11,13,11,"Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beth-el; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Beth-el: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them also they told unto their father."
11,13,12,"And their father said unto them, What way went he? Now his sons had seen what way the man of God went, that came from Judah."
11,13,13,"And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass; and he rode thereon."
11,13,14,"And he went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak; and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am."
11,13,15,"Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread."
11,13,16,"And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:"
11,13,17,"for it was said to me by the word of Jehovah, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest."
11,13,18,"And he said unto him, I also am a prophet as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of Jehovah, saying, Bring him back with thee into thy house, that he may eat bread and drink water. `But' he lied unto him."
11,13,19,"So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water."
11,13,20,"And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of Jehovah came unto the prophet that brought him back;"
11,13,21,"and he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, Forasmuch as thou hast been disobedient unto the mouth of Jehovah, and hast not kept the commandment which Jehovah thy God commanded thee,"
11,13,22,"but camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy body shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers."
11,13,23,"And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, `to wit', for the prophet whom he had brought back."
11,13,24,"And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his body was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it; the lion also stood by the body."
11,13,25,"And, behold, men passed by, and saw the body cast in the way, and the lion standing by the body; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt."
11,13,26,"And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the mouth of Jehovah: therefore Jehovah hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake unto him."
11,13,27,"And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled it."
11,13,28,"And he went and found his body cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the body: the lion had not eaten the body, nor torn the ass."
11,13,29,"And the prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back; and he came to the city of the old prophet, to mourn, and to bury him."
11,13,30,"And he laid his body in his own grave; and they mourned over him, `saying', Alas, my brother!"
11,13,31,"And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones."
11,13,32,"For the saying which he cried by the word of Jehovah against the altar in Beth-el, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass."
11,13,33,"After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again from among all the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, that there might be priests of the high places."
11,13,34,"And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth."
11,14,1,"At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick."
11,14,2,"And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, who spake concerning me that I should be king over this people."
11,14,3,"And take with thee ten loaves, and cakes, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he will tell thee what shall become of the child."
11,14,4,"And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age."
11,14,5,"And Jehovah said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to inquire of thee concerning her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her; for it will be, when she cometh in, that she will feign herself to be another woman."
11,14,6,"And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings."
11,14,7,"Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,"
11,14,8,"and rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee; and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes,"
11,14,9,"but hast done evil above all that were before thee, and hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:"
11,14,10,"therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every man-child, him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as a man sweepeth away dung, till it be all gone."
11,14,11,"Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat: for Jehovah hath spoken it."
11,14,12,"Arise thou therefore, get thee to thy house: `and' when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die."
11,14,13,"And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him; for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward Jehovah, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam."
11,14,14,"Moreover Jehovah will raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now."
11,14,15,"For Jehovah will smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and he will root up Israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their Asherim, provoking Jehovah to anger."
11,14,16,"And he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he hath sinned, and wherewith he hath made Israel to sin."
11,14,17,"And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: `and' as she came to the threshold of the house, the child died."
11,14,18,"And all Israel buried him, and mourned for him, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the prophet."
11,14,19,"And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel."
11,14,20,"And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead."
11,14,21,"And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there: and his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess."
11,14,22,"And Judah did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, above all that their fathers had done."
11,14,23,"For they also built them high places, and pillars, and Asherim, on every high hill, and under every green tree;"
11,14,24,"and there were also sodomites in the land: they did according to all the abominations of the nations which Jehovah drove out before the children of Israel."
11,14,25,"And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem;"
11,14,26,"and he took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made."
11,14,27,"And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king's house."
11,14,28,"And it was so, that, as oft as the king went into the house of Jehovah, the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber."
11,14,29,"Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
11,14,30,"And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually."
11,14,31,"And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead."
11,15,1,"Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat began Abijam to reign over Judah."
11,15,2,"Three years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom."
11,15,3,"And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God, as the heart of David his father."
11,15,4,"Nevertheless for David's sake did Jehovah his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem;"
11,15,5,"because David did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and turned not aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite."
11,15,6,"Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life."
11,15,7,"And the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam."
11,15,8,"And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead."
11,15,9,"And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Asa to reign over Judah."
11,15,10,"And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom."
11,15,11,"And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, as did David his father."
11,15,12,"And he put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made."
11,15,13,"And also Maacah his mother he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and burnt it at the brook Kidron."
11,15,14,"But the high places were not taken away: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect with Jehovah all his days."
11,15,15,"And he brought into the house of Jehovah the things that his father had dedicated, and the things that himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels."
11,15,16,"And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days."
11,15,17,"And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah."
11,15,18,"Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants; and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,"
11,15,19,"`There is' a league between me and thee, between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me."
11,15,20,"And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali."
11,15,21,"And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah."
11,15,22,"Then king Asa made a proclamation unto all Judah; none was exempted: and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built therewith Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah."
11,15,23,"Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet."
11,15,24,"And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead."
11,15,25,"And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah; and he reigned over Israel two years."
11,15,26,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin."
11,15,27,"And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon."
11,15,28,"Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead."
11,15,29,"And it came to pass that, as soon as he was king, he smote all the house of Jeroboam: he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him; according unto the saying of Jehovah, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite;"
11,15,30,"for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and wherewith he made Israel to sin, because of his provocation wherewith he provoked Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger."
11,15,31,"Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
11,15,32,"And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days."
11,15,33,"In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, `and reigned' twenty and four years."
11,15,34,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin."
11,16,1,"And the word of Jehovah came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,"
11,16,2,"Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel, and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;"
11,16,3,"behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house; and I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat."
11,16,4,"Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat."
11,16,5,"Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
11,16,6,"And Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah; and Elah his son reigned in his stead."
11,16,7,"And moreover by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of Jehovah against Baasha, and against his house, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and because he smote him."
11,16,8,"In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, `and reigned' two years."
11,16,9,"And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him. Now he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah:"
11,16,10,"and Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead."
11,16,11,"And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he smote all the house of Baasha: he left him not a single man-child, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends."
11,16,12,"Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,"
11,16,13,"for all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned, and wherewith they made Israel to sin, to provoke Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities."
11,16,14,"Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
11,16,15,"In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. Now the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines."
11,16,16,"And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also smitten the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp."
11,16,17,"And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah."
11,16,18,"And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the castle of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died,"
11,16,19,"for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin."
11,16,20,"Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
11,16,21,"Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri."
11,16,22,"But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned."
11,16,23,"In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, `and reigned' twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah."
11,16,24,"And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver; and he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill, Samaria."
11,16,25,"And Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and dealt wickedly above all that were before him."
11,16,26,"For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities."
11,16,27,"Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
11,16,28,"So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab his son reigned in his stead."
11,16,29,"And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years."
11,16,30,"And Ahab the son of Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah above all that were before him."
11,16,31,"And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him."
11,16,32,"And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria."
11,16,33,"And Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab did yet more to provoke Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him."
11,16,34,"In his days did Hiel the Beth-elite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof with the loss of Abiram his first-born, and set up the gates thereof with the loss of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun."
11,17,1,"And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the sojourners of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As Jehovah, the God of Israel, liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word."
11,17,2,"And the word of Jehovah came unto him, saying,"
11,17,3,"Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan."
11,17,4,"And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there."
11,17,5,"So he went and did according unto the word of Jehovah; for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan."
11,17,6,"And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook."
11,17,7,"And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land."
11,17,8,"And the word of Jehovah came unto him, saying,"
11,17,9,"Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Sidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow there to sustain thee."
11,17,10,"So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink."
11,17,11,"And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand."
11,17,12,"And she said, As Jehovah thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but a handful of meal in the jar, and a little oil in the cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die."
11,17,13,"And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said; but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it forth unto me, and afterward make for thee and for thy son."
11,17,14,"For thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, The jar of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that Jehovah sendeth rain upon the earth."
11,17,15,"And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat `many' days."
11,17,16,"The jar of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake by Elijah."
11,17,17,"And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him."
11,17,18,"And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? thou art come unto me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son!"
11,17,19,"And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the chamber, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed."
11,17,20,"And he cried unto Jehovah, and said, O Jehovah my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?"
11,17,21,"And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto Jehovah, and said, O Jehovah my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again."
11,17,22,"And Jehovah hearkened unto the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived."
11,17,23,"And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother; and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth."
11,17,24,"And the woman said to Elijah, Now I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of Jehovah in thy mouth is truth."
11,18,1,"And it came to pass after many days, that the word of Jehovah came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, Go, show thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth."
11,18,2,"And Elijah went to show himself unto Ahab. And the famine was sore in Samaria."
11,18,3,"And Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared Jehovah greatly:"
11,18,4,"for it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Jehovah, that Obadiah took a hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)"
11,18,5,"And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go through the land, unto all the fountains of water, and unto all the brooks: peradventure we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts."
11,18,6,"So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself."
11,18,7,"And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Is it thou, my lord Elijah?"
11,18,8,"And he answered him, It is I: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah `is here'."
11,18,9,"And he said, Wherein have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?"
11,18,10,"As Jehovah thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not here, he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not."
11,18,11,"And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah `is here'."
11,18,12,"And it will come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of Jehovah will carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he will slay me: but I thy servant fear Jehovah from my youth."
11,18,13,"Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of Jehovah, how I hid a hundred men of Jehovah's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?"
11,18,14,"And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah `is here'; and he will slay me."
11,18,15,"And Elijah said, As Jehovah of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself unto him to-day."
11,18,16,"So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah."
11,18,17,"And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Is it thou, thou troubler of Israel?"
11,18,18,"And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of Jehovah, and thou hast followed the Baalim."
11,18,19,"Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the Asherah four hundred, that eat at Jezebel's table."
11,18,20,"So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel."
11,18,21,"And Elijah came near unto all the people, and said, How long go ye limping between the two sides? if Jehovah be God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word."
11,18,22,"Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, am left a prophet of Jehovah; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men."
11,18,23,"Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under; and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under."
11,18,24,"And call ye on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of Jehovah; and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken."
11,18,25,"And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under."
11,18,26,"And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped about the altar which was made."
11,18,27,"And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud; for he is a god: either he is musing, or he is gone aside, or he is on a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth and must be awaked."
11,18,28,"And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lances, till the blood gushed out upon them."
11,18,29,"And it was so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the `evening' oblation; but there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded."
11,18,30,"And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me; and all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of Jehovah that was thrown down."
11,18,31,"And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of Jehovah came, saying, Israel shall be thy name."
11,18,32,"And with the stones he built an altar in the name of Jehovah; and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed."
11,18,33,"And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid it on the wood. And he said, Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt-offering, and on the wood."
11,18,34,"And he said, Do it the second time; and they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time; and they did it the third time."
11,18,35,"And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water."
11,18,36,"And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the `evening' oblation, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word."
11,18,37,"Hear me, O Jehovah, hear me, that this people may know that thou, Jehovah, art God, and `that' thou hast turned their heart back again."
11,18,38,"Then the fire of Jehovah fell, and consumed the burnt-offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench."
11,18,39,"And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, Jehovah, he is God; Jehovah, he is God."
11,18,40,"and Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them; and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there."
11,18,41,"And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain."
11,18,42,"So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees."
11,18,43,"And he said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times."
11,18,44,"And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a cloud out of the sea, as small as a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Make ready `thy chariot', and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not."
11,18,45,"And it came to pass in a little while, that the heavens grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel:"
11,18,46,"and the hand of Jehovah was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel."
11,19,1,"And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword."
11,19,2,"Then Jezebel send a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to-morrow about this time."
11,19,3,"And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there."
11,19,4,"But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper-tree: and he requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is enough; now, O Jehovah, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers."
11,19,5,"And he lay down and slept under a juniper-tree; and, behold, an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat."
11,19,6,"And he looked, and, behold, there was at his head a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again."
11,19,7,"And the angel of Jehovah came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat, because the journey is too great for thee."
11,19,8,"And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God."
11,19,9,"And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of Jehovah came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?"
11,19,10,"And he said, I have been very jealous for Jehovah, the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword: and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away."
11,19,11,"And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before Jehovah. And, behold, Jehovah passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before Jehovah; but Jehovah was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but Jehovah was not in the earthquake:"
11,19,12,"and after the earthquake a fire; but Jehovah was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice."
11,19,13,"And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?"
11,19,14,"And he said, I have been very jealous for Jehovah, the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away."
11,19,15,"And Jehovah said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, thou shalt anoint Hazael to be king over Syria;"
11,19,16,"and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel; and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room."
11,19,17,"And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay; and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay."
11,19,18,"Yet will I leave `me' seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him."
11,19,19,"So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing, with twelve yoke `of oxen' before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed over unto him, and cast his mantle upon him."
11,19,20,"And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again; for what have I done to thee?"
11,19,21,"And he returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him."
11,20,1,"And Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together; and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it."
11,20,2,"And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Ben-hadad,"
11,20,3,"Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine."
11,20,4,"And the king of Israel answered and said, It is according to thy saying, my lord, O king; I am thine, and all that I have."
11,20,5,"And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying, I sent indeed unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;"
11,20,6,"but I will send my servants unto thee to-morrow about this time, and they shall search thy house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away."
11,20,7,"Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not."
11,20,8,"And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken thou not, neither consent."
11,20,9,"Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do; but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again."
11,20,10,"And Ben-hadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me."
11,20,11,"And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that girdeth on `his armor' boast himself as he that putteth it off."
11,20,12,"And it came to pass, when `Ben-hadad' heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings, in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Set `yourselves in array'. And they set `themselves in array' against the city."
11,20,13,"And, behold, a prophet came near unto Ahab king of Israel, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thy hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah."
11,20,14,"And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith Jehovah, By the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall begin the battle? And he answered, Thou."
11,20,15,"Then he mustered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two: and after them he mustered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand."
11,20,16,"And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him."
11,20,17,"And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out from Samaria."
11,20,18,"And he said, Whether they are come out for peace, take them alive, or whether they are come out for war, taken them alive."
11,20,19,"So these went out of the city, the young men of the princes of the provinces, and the army which followed them."
11,20,20,"And they slew every one his man; and the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them: and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen."
11,20,21,"And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter."
11,20,22,"And the prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest; for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee."
11,20,23,"And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their god is a god of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we: but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they."
11,20,24,"And do this thing: take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their room;"
11,20,25,"and number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot; and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so."
11,20,26,"And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad mustered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel."
11,20,27,"And the children of Israel were mustered, and were victualled, and went against them: and the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country."
11,20,28,"And a man of God came near and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, Because the Syrians have said, Jehovah is a god of the hills, but he is not a god of the valleys; therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thy hand, and ye shall know that I am Jehovah."
11,20,29,"And they encamped one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians a hundred thousand footmen in one day."
11,20,30,"But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand men that were left. And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber."
11,20,31,"And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, we pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life."
11,20,32,"So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and `put' ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben-hadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother."
11,20,33,"Now the men observed diligently, and hasted to catch whether it were his mind; and they said, Thy brother Ben-hadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Ben-hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot."
11,20,34,"And `Ben-hadad' said unto him, The cities which my father took from thy father I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. And I, `said Ahab', will let thee go with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and let him go."
11,20,35,"And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his fellow by the word of Jehovah, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him."
11,20,36,"Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of Jehovah, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him."
11,20,37,"Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, smiting and wounding him."
11,20,38,"So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes."
11,20,39,"And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king; and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver."
11,20,40,"And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it."
11,20,41,"And he hasted, and took the headband away from his eyes; and the king of israel discerned him that he was of the prophets."
11,20,42,"And he said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Because thou hast let go out of thy hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people."
11,20,43,"And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria."
11,21,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria."
11,21,2,"And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house; and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it: or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money."
11,21,3,"And Naboth said to Ahab, Jehovah forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee."
11,21,4,"And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread."
11,21,5,"But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?"
11,21,6,"And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee `another' vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard."
11,21,7,"And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thy heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite."
11,21,8,"So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, `and' that dwelt with Naboth."
11,21,9,"And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:"
11,21,10,"and set two men, base fellows, before him, and let them bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst curse God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him to death."
11,21,11,"And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who dwelt in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, according as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them."
11,21,12,"They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people."
11,21,13,"And the two men, the base fellows, came in and sat before him: and the base fellows bare witness against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did curse God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him to death with stones."
11,21,14,"Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead."
11,21,15,"And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead."
11,21,16,"And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it."
11,21,17,"And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,"
11,21,18,"Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwelleth in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to take possession of it."
11,21,19,"And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, Hast thou killed and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine."
11,21,20,"And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found thee, because thou hast sold thyself to do that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah."
11,21,21,"Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will utterly sweep thee away and will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel:"
11,21,22,"and I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and hast made Israel to sin."
11,21,23,"And of Jezebel also spake Jehovah, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel."
11,21,24,"Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat."
11,21,25,"(But there was none like unto Ahab, who did sell himself to do that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up."
11,21,26,"And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel.)"
11,21,27,"And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly."
11,21,28,"And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,"
11,21,29,"Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house."
11,22,1,"And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel."
11,22,2,"And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel."
11,22,3,"And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth-gilead is ours, and we are still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?"
11,22,4,"And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses."
11,22,5,"And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire first, I pray thee, for the word of Jehovah."
11,22,6,"Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king."
11,22,7,"But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, that we may inquire of him?"
11,22,8,"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, there is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah, Micaiah the son of Imlah: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so."
11,22,9,"Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah."
11,22,10,"Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them."
11,22,11,"And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until they be consumed."
11,22,12,"And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper; for Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king."
11,22,13,"And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets `declare' good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak thou good."
11,22,14,"And Micaiah said, As Jehovah liveth, what Jehovah saith unto me, that will I speak."
11,22,15,"And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go up and prosper; and Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king."
11,22,16,"And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah?"
11,22,17,"And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and Jehovah said, These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace."
11,22,18,"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?"
11,22,19,"And `Micaiah' said, Therefore hear thou the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left."
11,22,20,"And Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner; and another said on that manner."
11,22,21,"And there came forth a spirit, and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him."
11,22,22,"And Jehovah said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt entice him, and shalt prevail also: go forth, and do so."
11,22,23,"Now therefore, behold, Jehovah hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets; and Jehovah hath spoken evil concerning thee."
11,22,24,"Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of Jehovah from me to speak unto thee?"
11,22,25,"And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself."
11,22,26,"And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;"
11,22,27,"and say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace."
11,22,28,"And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, Jehovah hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, ye peoples, all of you."
11,22,29,"So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead."
11,22,30,"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle."
11,22,31,"Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty and two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel."
11,22,32,"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel; and they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out."
11,22,33,"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him."
11,22,34,"And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded."
11,22,35,"And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even; and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot."
11,22,36,"And there went a cry throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his country."
11,22,37,"So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria."
11,22,38,"And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood (now the harlots washed themselves `there'); according unto the word of Jehovah which he spake."
11,22,39,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
11,22,40,"So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead."
11,22,41,"And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel."
11,22,42,"Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi."
11,22,43,"And he walked in all the way of Asa his father; He turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah: howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places."
11,22,44,"And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel."
11,22,45,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
11,22,46,"And the remnant of the sodomites, that remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away out of the land."
11,22,47,"And there was no king in Edom: a deputy was king."
11,22,48,"Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber."
11,22,49,"Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not."
11,22,50,"And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead."
11,22,51,"Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel."
11,22,52,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherein he made Israel to sin."
11,22,53,"And he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger Jehovah, the God of Israel, according to all that his father had done."
12,1,1,"And Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab."
12,1,2,"And Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover of this sickness."
12,1,3,"But the angel of Jehovah said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that ye go to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?"
12,1,4,"Now therefore thus saith Jehovah, Thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed."
12,1,5,"And the messengers returned unto him, and he said unto them, Why is it that ye are returned?"
12,1,6,"And they said unto him, There came up a man to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that thou sendest to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up, but shalt surely die."
12,1,7,"And he said unto them, What manner of man was he that came up to meet you, and told you these words?"
12,1,8,"And they answered him, He was a hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite."
12,1,9,"Then `the king' sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he was sitting on the top of the hill. And he spake unto him, O man of God, the king hath said, Come down."
12,1,10,"And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty."
12,1,11,"And again he sent unto him another captain of fifty and his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly."
12,1,12,"And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty."
12,1,13,"And again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight."
12,1,14,"Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties; but now let my life be precious in thy sight."
12,1,15,"And the angel of Jehovah said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king."
12,1,16,"And he said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up, but shalt surely die."
12,1,17,"So he died according to the word of Jehovah which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram began to reign in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son."
12,1,18,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
12,2,1,"And it came to pass, when Jehovah would take up Elijah by a whirlwind into heaven, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal."
12,2,2,"And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for Jehovah hath sent me as far as Beth-el. And Elisha said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Beth-el."
12,2,3,"And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that Jehovah will take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace."
12,2,4,"And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for Jehovah hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho."
12,2,5,"And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that Jehovah will take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace."
12,2,6,"And Elijah said unto him, Tarry here, I pray thee; for Jehovah hath sent me to the Jordan. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on."
12,2,7,"And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood over against them afar off: and they two stood by the Jordan."
12,2,8,"And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground."
12,2,9,"And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me."
12,2,10,"And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: `nevertheless', if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so."
12,2,11,"And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, `there appeared' a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, which parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven."
12,2,12,"And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof! And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces."
12,2,13,"He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan."
12,2,14,"And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they were divided hither and thither; and Elisha went over."
12,2,15,"And when the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho over against him saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him."
12,2,16,"And they said unto him, Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master, lest the Spirit of Jehovah hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send."
12,2,17,"And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not."
12,2,18,"And they came back to him, while he tarried at Jericho; and he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?"
12,2,19,"And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, we pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is bad, and the land miscarrieth."
12,2,20,"And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him."
12,2,21,"And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or miscarrying."
12,2,22,"So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spake."
12,2,23,"And he went up from thence unto Beth-el; and as he was going up by the way, there came forth young lads out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou baldhead; go up, thou baldhead."
12,2,24,"And he looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of Jehovah. And there came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two lads of them."
12,2,25,"And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria."
12,3,1,"Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years."
12,3,2,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, but not like his father, and like his mother; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made."
12,3,3,"Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom."
12,3,4,"Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master; and he rendered unto the king of Israel the wool of a hundred thousand lambs, and of a hundred thousand rams."
12,3,5,"But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel."
12,3,6,"And king Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel."
12,3,7,"And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses."
12,3,8,"And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way of the wilderness of Edom."
12,3,9,"So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, nor for the beasts that followed them."
12,3,10,"And the king of Israel said, Alas! for Jehovah hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab."
12,3,11,"But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah, that we may inquire of Jehovah by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah."
12,3,12,"And Jehoshaphat said, The word of Jehovah is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him."
12,3,13,"And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay; for Jehovah hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab."
12,3,14,"And Elisha said, As Jehovah of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee."
12,3,15,"But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of Jehovah came upon him."
12,3,16,"And he said, Thus saith Jehovah, Make this valley full of trenches."
12,3,17,"For thus saith Jehovah, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, and ye shall drink, both ye and your cattle and your beasts."
12,3,18,"And this is but a light thing in the sight of Jehovah: he will also deliver the Moabites into your hand."
12,3,19,"And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all fountains of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones."
12,3,20,"And it came to pass in the morning, about the time of offering the oblation, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water."
12,3,21,"Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all that were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood on the border."
12,3,22,"And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood:"
12,3,23,"and they said, This is blood; the kings are surely destroyed, and they have smitten each man his fellow: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil."
12,3,24,"And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land smiting the Moabites."
12,3,25,"And they beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the fountains of water, and felled all the good trees, until in Kir-hareseth `only' they left the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it."
12,3,26,"And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew sword, to break through unto the king of Edom; but they could not."
12,3,27,"Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt-offering upon the wall. And there was great wrath against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land."
12,4,1,"Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear Jehovah: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two children to be bondmen."
12,4,2,"And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me; what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thy handmaid hath not anything in the house, save a pot of oil."
12,4,3,"Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few."
12,4,4,"And thou shalt go in, and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and pour out into all those vessels; and thou shalt set aside that which is full."
12,4,5,"So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons; they brought `the vessels' to her, and she poured out."
12,4,6,"And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed."
12,4,7,"Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy sons of the rest."
12,4,8,"And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread."
12,4,9,"And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passeth by us continually."
12,4,10,"Let us make, I pray thee, a little chamber on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a seat, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither."
12,4,11,"And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber and lay there."
12,4,12,"And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him."
12,4,13,"And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people."
12,4,14,"And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no son, and her husband is old."
12,4,15,"And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door."
12,4,16,"And he said, At this season, when the time cometh round, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thy handmaid."
12,4,17,"And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season, when the time came round, as Elisha had said unto her."
12,4,18,"And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers."
12,4,19,"And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to his servant, Carry him to his mother."
12,4,20,"And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died."
12,4,21,"And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut `the door' upon him, and went out."
12,4,22,"And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the servants, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again."
12,4,23,"And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to-day? it is neither new moon nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well."
12,4,24,"Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slacken me not the riding, except I bid thee."
12,4,25,"So she went, and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is the Shunammite:"
12,4,26,"run, I pray thee, now to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well."
12,4,27,"And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, Let her alone: for her soul is vexed within her; and Jehovah hath hid it from me, and hath not told me."
12,4,28,"Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?"
12,4,29,"Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child."
12,4,30,"And the mother of the child said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her."
12,4,31,"And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked."
12,4,32,"And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed."
12,4,33,"He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto Jehovah."
12,4,34,"And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon him; and the flesh of the child waxed warm."
12,4,35,"Then he returned, and walked in the house once to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes."
12,4,36,"And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son."
12,4,37,"Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; and she took up her son, and went out."
12,4,38,"And Elisha came again to Gilgal. And there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets."
12,4,39,"And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage; for they knew them not."
12,4,40,"So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof."
12,4,41,"But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot."
12,4,42,"And there came a man from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain in his sack. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat."
12,4,43,"And his servant said, What, should I set this before a hundred men? But he said, Give the people, that they may eat; for thus saith Jehovah, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof."
12,4,44,"So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of Jehovah."
12,5,1,"Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him Jehovah had given victory unto Syria: he was also a mighty man of valor, `but he was' a leper."
12,5,2,"And the Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden; and she waited on Naaman's wife."
12,5,3,"And she said unto her mistress, Would that my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! then would he recover him of his leprosy."
12,5,4,"And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maiden that is of the land of Israel."
12,5,5,"And the king of Syria said, Go now, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand `pieces' of gold, and ten changes of raiment."
12,5,6,"And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, And now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy."
12,5,7,"And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? but consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me."
12,5,8,"And it was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel."
12,5,9,"So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha."
12,5,10,"And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean."
12,5,11,"But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of Jehovah his God, and wave his hand over the place, and recover the leper."
12,5,12,"Are not Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage."
12,5,13,"And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?"
12,5,14,"Then went he down, and dipped `himself' seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean."
12,5,15,"And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, Behold now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a present of thy servant."
12,5,16,"But he said, As Jehovah liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused."
12,5,17,"And Naaman said, If not, yet, I pray thee, let there be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth; for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt-offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto Jehovah."
12,5,18,"In this thing Jehovah pardon thy servant: when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, Jehovah pardon thy servant in this thing."
12,5,19,"And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way."
12,5,20,"But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: as Jehovah liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him."
12,5,21,"So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw one running after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?"
12,5,22,"And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there are come to me from the hill-country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets; give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of raiment."
12,5,23,"And Naaman said, Be pleased to take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of raiment, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him."
12,5,24,"And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house; and he let the men go, and they departed."
12,5,25,"But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither."
12,5,26,"And he said unto him, Went not my heart `with thee', when the man turned from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards and vineyards, and sheep and oxen, and men-servants and maid-servants?"
12,5,27,"The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper `as white' as snow."
12,6,1,"And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell before thee is too strait for us."
12,6,2,"Let us go, we pray thee, unto the Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye."
12,6,3,"And one said, Be pleased, I pray thee, to go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go."
12,6,4,"So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down wood."
12,6,5,"But as one was felling a beam, the axe-head fell into the water; and he cried, and said, Alas, my master! for it was borrowed."
12,6,6,"And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither, and made the iron to swim."
12,6,7,"And he said, Take it up to thee. So he put out his hand, and took it."
12,6,8,"Now the king of Syria was warring against Israel; and he took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp."
12,6,9,"And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are coming down."
12,6,10,"And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of; and he saved himself there, not once nor twice."
12,6,11,"And the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?"
12,6,12,"And one of his servants said, Nay, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber."
12,6,13,"And he said, Go and see where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan."
12,6,14,"Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about."
12,6,15,"And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, a host with horses and chariots was round about the city. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?"
12,6,16,"And he answered, Fear not; for they that are with us are more than they that are with them."
12,6,17,"And Elisha prayed, and said, Jehovah, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And Jehovah opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha."
12,6,18,"And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto Jehovah, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha."
12,6,19,"And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. And he led them to Samaria."
12,6,20,"And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, Jehovah, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And Jehovah opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria."
12,6,21,"And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?"
12,6,22,"And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master."
12,6,23,"And he prepared great provision for them; and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel."
12,6,24,"And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria."
12,6,25,"And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore `pieces' of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove's dung for five `pieces' of silver."
12,6,26,"And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king."
12,6,27,"And he said, If Jehovah do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the threshing-floor, or out of the winepress?"
12,6,28,"And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to-day, and we will eat my son to-morrow."
12,6,29,"So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him; and she hath hid her son."
12,6,30,"And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes (now he was passing by upon the wall); and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh."
12,6,31,"Then he said, God do so to me, and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day."
12,6,32,"But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him; and `the king' sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away my head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold the door fast against him: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?"
12,6,33,"And while he was yet talking with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of Jehovah; why should I wait for Jehovah any longer?"
12,7,1,"And Elisha said, Hear ye the word of Jehovah: thus saith Jehovah, To-morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be `sold' for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria."
12,7,2,"Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if Jehovah should make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof."
12,7,3,"Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?"
12,7,4,"If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die."
12,7,5,"And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians; and when they were come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no man there."
12,7,6,"For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us."
12,7,7,"Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life."
12,7,8,"And when these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and they came back, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it."
12,7,9,"Then they said one to another, We do not well; this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, punishment will overtake us; now therefore come, let us go and tell the king's household."
12,7,10,"So they came and called unto the porter of the city; and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but the horses tied, and the asses tied, and the tents as they were."
12,7,11,"And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's household within."
12,7,12,"And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city."
12,7,13,"And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it; behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are consumed); and let us send and see."
12,7,14,"They took therefore two chariots with horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see."
12,7,15,"And they went after them unto the Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king."
12,7,16,"And the people went out, and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was `sold' for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of Jehovah."
12,7,17,"And the king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him."
12,7,18,"And it came to pass, as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to-morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria;"
12,7,19,"and that captain answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if Jehovah should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? and he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof:"
12,7,20,"it came to pass even so unto him; for the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died."
12,8,1,"Now Elisha had spoken unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thy household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for Jehovah hath called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years."
12,8,2,"And the woman arose, and did according to the word of the man of God; and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years."
12,8,3,"And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land."
12,8,4,"Now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done."
12,8,5,"And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored to life him that was dead, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life."
12,8,6,"And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now."
12,8,7,"And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither."
12,8,8,"And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thy hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of Jehovah by him, saying, Shall I recover of this sickness?"
12,8,9,"So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this sickness?"
12,8,10,"And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou shalt surely recover; howbeit Jehovah hath showed me that he shall surely die."
12,8,11,"And he settled his countenance stedfastly `upon him', until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept."
12,8,12,"And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strongholds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash in pieces their little ones, and rip up their women with child."
12,8,13,"And Hazael said, But what is thy servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, Jehovah hath showed me that thou shalt be king over Syria."
12,8,14,"Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou wouldest surely recover."
12,8,15,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took the coverlet, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead."
12,8,16,"And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign."
12,8,17,"Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem."
12,8,18,"And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife; and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah."
12,8,19,"Howbeit Jehovah would not destroy Judah, for David his servant's sake, as he promised him to give unto him a lamp for his children alway."
12,8,20,"In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves."
12,8,21,"Then Joram passed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites that compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled to their tents."
12,8,22,"So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then did Libnah revolt at the same time."
12,8,23,"And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12,8,24,"And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead."
12,8,25,"In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign."
12,8,26,"Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel."
12,8,27,"And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did the house of Ahab; for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab."
12,8,28,"And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians wounded Joram."
12,8,29,"And king Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick."
12,9,1,"And Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this vial of oil in thy hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead."
12,9,2,"And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber."
12,9,3,"Then take the vial of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith Jehovah, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not."
12,9,4,"So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead."
12,9,5,"And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of us all? And he said, To thee, O captain."
12,9,6,"And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of Jehovah, even over Israel."
12,9,7,"And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of Jehovah, at the hand of Jezebel."
12,9,8,"For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; and I will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel."
12,9,9,"And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah."
12,9,10,"And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled."
12,9,11,"Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man and what his talk was."
12,9,12,"And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, I have anointed thee king over Israel."
12,9,13,"Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew the trumpet, saying, Jehu is king."
12,9,14,"So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram was keeping Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria;"
12,9,15,"but king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If this be your mind, then let none escape and go forth out of the city, to go to tell it in Jezreel."
12,9,16,"So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram."
12,9,17,"Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?"
12,9,18,"So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not back."
12,9,19,"Then he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me."
12,9,20,"And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not back: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously."
12,9,21,"And Joram said, Make ready. And they made ready his chariot. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and found him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite."
12,9,22,"And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?"
12,9,23,"And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah."
12,9,24,"And Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and smote Joram between his arms; and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot."
12,9,25,"Then said `Jehu' to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, Jehovah laid this burden upon him:"
12,9,26,"Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith Jehovah; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith Jehovah. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat `of ground', according to the word of Jehovah."
12,9,27,"But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden-house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot: `and they smote him' at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there."
12,9,28,"And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David."
12,9,29,"And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah."
12,9,30,"And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and attired her head, and looked out at the window."
12,9,31,"And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Is it peace, thou Zimri, thy master's murderer?"
12,9,32,"And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs."
12,9,33,"And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trod her under foot."
12,9,34,"And when he was come in, he did eat and drink; and he said, See now to this cursed woman, and bury her; for she is a king's daughter."
12,9,35,"And they went to bury her; but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands."
12,9,36,"Wherefore they came back, and told him. And he said, This is the word of Jehovah, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall the dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel;"
12,9,37,"and the body of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel, so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel."
12,10,1,"Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, even the elders, and unto them that brought up `the sons of' Ahab, saying,"
12,10,2,"And now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and armor;"
12,10,3,"look ye out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house."
12,10,4,"But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, the two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?"
12,10,5,"And he that was over the household, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and they that brought up `the children', sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any man king: do thou that which is good in thine eyes."
12,10,6,"Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be on my side, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to-morrow this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who brought them up."
12,10,7,"And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew them, even seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them unto him to Jezreel."
12,10,8,"And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning."
12,10,9,"And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye are righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him; but who smote all these?"
12,10,10,"Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of Jehovah, which Jehovah spake concerning the house of Ahab: for Jehovah hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah."
12,10,11,"So Jehu smote all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his familiar friends, and his priests, until he left him none remaining."
12,10,12,"And he arose and departed, and went to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing-house of the shepherds in the way,"
12,10,13,"Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah: and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen."
12,10,14,"And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing-house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them."
12,10,15,"And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him; and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thy heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thy hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot."
12,10,16,"And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for Jehovah. So they made him ride in his chariot."
12,10,17,"And when he came to Samaria, he smote all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake to Elijah."
12,10,18,"And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve him much."
12,10,19,"Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his worshippers, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice `to do' to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtlety, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal."
12,10,20,"And Jehu said, Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it."
12,10,21,"And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another."
12,10,22,"And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments."
12,10,23,"And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal; and he said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of Jehovah, but the worshippers of Baal only."
12,10,24,"And they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt-offerings. Now Jehu had appointed him fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I bring into your hands escape, `he that letteth him go', his life shall be for the life of him."
12,10,25,"And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal."
12,10,26,"And they brought forth the pillars that were in the house of Baal, and burned them."
12,10,27,"And they brake down the pillar of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and made it a draught-house, unto this day."
12,10,28,"Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel."
12,10,29,"Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, `to wit', the golden calves that were in Beth-el, and that were in Dan."
12,10,30,"And Jehovah said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, `and' hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, thy sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel."
12,10,31,"But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of Jehovah, the God of Israel, with all his heart: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, wherewith he made Israel to sin."
12,10,32,"In those days Jehovah began to cut off from Israel: and Hazael smote them in all the borders of Israel;"
12,10,33,"from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan."
12,10,34,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
12,10,35,"And Jehu slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead."
12,10,36,"And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years."
12,11,1,"Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal."
12,11,2,"But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king's sons that were slain, even him and his nurse, `and put them' in the bedchamber; and they hid him from Athaliah, so that he was not slain;"
12,11,3,"And he was with her hid in the house of Jehovah six years. And Athaliah reigned over the land."
12,11,4,"And in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds of the Carites and of the guard, and brought them to him into the house of Jehovah; and he made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of Jehovah, and showed them the king's son."
12,11,5,"And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do: a third part of you, that come in on the sabbath, shall be keepers of the watch of the king's house;"
12,11,6,"And a third part shall be at the gate Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, and be a barrier."
12,11,7,"And the two companies of you, even all that go forth on the sabbath, shall keep the watch of the house of Jehovah about the king."
12,11,8,"And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and he that cometh within the ranks, let him be slain: and be ye with the king when he goeth out, and when he cometh in."
12,11,9,"And the captains over hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they took every man his men, those that were to come in on the sabbath, with those that were to go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest."
12,11,10,"And the priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been king David's, which were in the house of Jehovah."
12,11,11,"And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the king round about."
12,11,12,"Then he brought out the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and `gave him' the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, `Long' live the king."
12,11,13,"And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard `and of' the people, she came to the people into the house of Jehovah:"
12,11,14,"and she looked, and, behold, the king stood by the pillar, as the manner was, and the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason! treason!"
12,11,15,"And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth between the ranks; and him that followeth her slay with the sword. For the priest said, Let her not be slain in the house of Jehovah."
12,11,16,"So they made way for her; and she went by the way of the horses' entry to the king's house: and there was she slain."
12,11,17,"And Jehoiada made a covenant between Jehovah and the king and the people, that they should be Jehovah's people; between the king also and the people."
12,11,18,"And all the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of Jehovah."
12,11,19,"And he took the captains over hundreds, and the Carites, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of Jehovah, and came by the way of the gate of the guard unto the king's house. And he sat on the throne of the kings."
12,11,20,"So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. And Athaliah they had slain with the sword at the king's house."
12,11,21,"Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign."
12,12,1,"In the seventh year of Jehu began Jehoash to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba."
12,12,2,"And Jehoash did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him."
12,12,3,"Howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places."
12,12,4,"And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the hallowed things that is brought into the house of Jehovah, in current money, the money of the persons for whom each man is rated, and all the money that it cometh into any man's heart to bring into the house of Jehovah,"
12,12,5,"let the priests take it to them, every man from his acquaintance; and they shall repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be found."
12,12,6,"But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house."
12,12,7,"Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and for the `other' priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house? now therefore take no `more' money from your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house."
12,12,8,"And the priests consented that they should take no `more' money from the people, neither repair the breaches of the house."
12,12,9,"But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of Jehovah: and the priests that kept the threshold put therein all the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah."
12,12,10,"And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of Jehovah."
12,12,11,"And they gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of Jehovah: and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders, that wrought upon the house of Jehovah,"
12,12,12,"and to the masons and the hewers of stone, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the breaches of the house of Jehovah, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it."
12,12,13,"But there were not made for the house of Jehovah cups of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah;"
12,12,14,"for they gave that to them that did the work, and repaired therewith the house of Jehovah."
12,12,15,"Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to give to them that did the work; for they dealt faithfully."
12,12,16,"The money for the trespass-offerings, and the money for the sin-offerings, was not brought into the house of Jehovah: it was the priests'."
12,12,17,"Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it; and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem."
12,12,18,"And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and of the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem."
12,12,19,"Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12,12,20,"And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and smote Joash at the house of Millo, `on the way' that goeth down to Silla."
12,12,21,"For Jozacar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead."
12,13,1,"In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, `and reigned' seventeen years."
12,13,2,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom."
12,13,3,"And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, continually."
12,13,4,"And Jehoahaz besought Jehovah, and Jehovah hearkened unto him; for he saw the oppression of Israel, how that the king of Syria oppressed them."
12,13,5,"(And Jehovah gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians; and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents as beforetime."
12,13,6,"Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, wherewith he made Israel to sin, but walked therein: and there remained the Asherah also in Samaria.)"
12,13,7,"For he left not to Jehoahaz of the people save fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria destroyed them, and made them like the dust in threshing."
12,13,8,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
12,13,9,"And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead."
12,13,10,"In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, `and reigned' sixteen years."
12,13,11,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; but he walked therein."
12,13,12,"Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
12,13,13,"And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel."
12,13,14,"Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died: and Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over him, and said, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof!"
12,13,15,"And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows; and he took unto him bow and arrows."
12,13,16,"And he said to the king of Israel, Put thy hand upon the bow; and he put his hand `upon it'. And Elisha laid his hands upon the king's hands."
12,13,17,"And he said, Open the window eastward; and he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot; and he shot. And he said, Jehovah's arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory over Syria; for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them."
12,13,18,"And he said, Take the arrows; and he took them. And he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground; and he smote thrice, and stayed."
12,13,19,"And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times: then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it, whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice."
12,13,20,"And Elisha died, and they buried him. Now the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year."
12,13,21,"And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet."
12,13,22,"And Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz."
12,13,23,"But Jehovah was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet."
12,13,24,"And Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead."
12,13,25,"And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash smite him, and recovered the cities of Israel."
12,14,1,"In the second year of Joash son of Joahaz king of Israel began Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah to reign."
12,14,2,"He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem."
12,14,3,"And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, yet not like David his father: he did according to all that Joash his father had done."
12,14,4,"Howbeit the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places."
12,14,5,"And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand, that he slew his servants who had slain the king his father:"
12,14,6,"but the children of the murderers he put not to death; according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, as Jehovah commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin."
12,14,7,"He slew of Edom in the Valley of Salt ten thousand, and took Sela by war, and called the name of it Joktheel, unto this day."
12,14,8,"Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face."
12,14,9,"And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle."
12,14,10,"Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thy heart hath lifted thee up: glory thereof, and abide at home; for why shouldest thou meddle to `thy' hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?"
12,14,11,"But Amaziah would not hear. So Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah."
12,14,12,"And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent."
12,14,13,"And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits."
12,14,14,"And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of Jehovah, and in the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria."
12,14,15,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
12,14,16,"And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead."
12,14,17,"And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years."
12,14,18,"Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12,14,19,"And they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there."
12,14,20,"And they brought him upon horses; and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David."
12,14,21,"And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah."
12,14,22,"He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers."
12,14,23,"In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, `and reigned' forty and one years."
12,14,24,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin."
12,14,25,"He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath unto the sea of the Arabah, according to the word of Jehovah, the God of Israel, which he spake by his servant Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet, who was of Gath-hepher."
12,14,26,"For Jehovah saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter; for there was none shut up nor left at large, neither was there any helper for Israel."
12,14,27,"And Jehovah said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven; but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash."
12,14,28,"Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, `which had belonged' to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
12,14,29,"And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zechariah his son reigned in his stead."
12,15,1,"In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign."
12,15,2,"Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem."
12,15,3,"And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Amaziah had done."
12,15,4,"Howbeit the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places."
12,15,5,"And Jehovah smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house. And Jotham the king's son was over the household, judging the people of the land."
12,15,6,"Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12,15,7,"And Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead."
12,15,8,"In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zechariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months."
12,15,9,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin."
12,15,10,"And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead."
12,15,11,"Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel."
12,15,12,"This was the word of Jehovah which he spake unto Jehu, saying, Thy sons to the fourth generation shall sit upon the throne of Israel. And so it came to pass."
12,15,13,"Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned the space of a month in Samaria."
12,15,14,"And Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead."
12,15,15,"Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel."
12,15,16,"Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the borders thereof, from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore he smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up."
12,15,17,"In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, `and reigned' ten years in Samaria."
12,15,18,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin."
12,15,19,"There came against the land Pul the king of Assyria; and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand."
12,15,20,"And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land."
12,15,21,"Now the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
12,15,22,"And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead."
12,15,23,"In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, `and reigned' two years."
12,15,24,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin."
12,15,25,"And Pekah the son of Remaliah, his captain, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the castle of the king's house, with Argob and Arieh; and with him were fifty men of the Gileadites: and he slew him, and reigned in his stead."
12,15,26,"Now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel."
12,15,27,"In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, `and reigned' twenty years."
12,15,28,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin."
12,15,29,"In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maacah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali; and he carried them captive to Assyria."
12,15,30,"And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah."

12,15,32,"In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign."
12,15,33,"Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok."
12,15,34,"And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah; he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done."
12,15,35,"Howbeit the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places. He built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah."
12,15,36,"Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12,15,37,"In those days Jehovah began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah."
12,15,38,"And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead."
12,16,1,"In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign."
12,16,2,"Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he did not that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah his God, like David his father."
12,16,3,"But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the nations, whom Jehovah cast out from before the children of Israel."
12,16,4,"And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree."
12,16,5,"Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him."
12,16,6,"At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath; and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there, unto this day."
12,16,7,"So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me."
12,16,8,"And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Jehovah, and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria."
12,16,9,"And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him; and the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried `the people of' it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin."
12,16,10,"And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and saw the altar that was at Damascus; and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof."
12,16,11,"And Urijah the priest built an altar: according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so did Urijah the priest make it against the coming of king Ahaz from Damascus."
12,16,12,"And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king drew near unto the altar, and offered thereon."
12,16,13,"And he burnt his burnt-offering and his meal-offering, and poured his drink-offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace-offerings, upon the altar."
12,16,14,"And the brazen altar, which was before Jehovah, he brought from the forefront of the house, from between his altar and the house of Jehovah, and put it on the north side of his altar."
12,16,15,"And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt-offering, and the evening meal-offering, and the king's burnt-offering, and his meal-offering, with the burnt-offering of all the people of the land, and their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt-offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: but the brazen altar shall be for me to inquire by."
12,16,16,"Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded."
12,16,17,"And king Ahaz cut off the panels of the bases, and removed the laver from off them, and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stone."
12,16,18,"And the covered way for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry without, turned he unto the house of Jehovah, because of the king of Assyria."
12,16,19,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12,16,20,"And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead."
12,17,1,"In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel, `and reigned' nine years."
12,17,2,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, yet not as the kings of Israel that were before him."
12,17,3,"Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and brought him tribute."
12,17,4,"And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison."
12,17,5,"Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years."
12,17,6,"In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away unto Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes."
12,17,7,"And it was so, because the children of Israel had sinned against Jehovah their God, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,"
12,17,8,"and walked in the statutes of the nations, whom Jehovah cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they made."
12,17,9,"And the children of Israel did secretly things that were not right against Jehovah their God: and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city;"
12,17,10,"and they set them up pillars and Asherim upon every high hill, and under every green tree;"
12,17,11,"and there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the nations whom Jehovah carried away before them; and they wrought wicked things to provoke Jehovah to anger;"
12,17,12,"and they served idols, whereof Jehovah had said unto them, Ye shall not do this thing."
12,17,13,"Yet Jehovah testified unto Israel, and unto Judah, by every prophet, and every seer, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets."
12,17,14,"Notwithstanding, they would not hear, but hardened their neck, like to the neck of their fathers, who believed not in Jehovah their God."
12,17,15,"And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified unto them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and `went' after the nations that were round about them, concerning whom Jehovah had charged them that they should not do like them."
12,17,16,"And they forsook all the commandments of Jehovah their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made an Asherah, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal."
12,17,17,"And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger."
12,17,18,"Therefore Jehovah was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only."
12,17,19,"Also Judah kept not the commandments of Jehovah their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made."
12,17,20,"And Jehovah rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight."
12,17,21,"For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drove Israel from following Jehovah, and made them sin a great sin."
12,17,22,"And the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;"
12,17,23,"until Jehovah removed Israel out of his sight, as he spake by all his servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day."
12,17,24,"And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel; and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof."
12,17,25,"And so it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not Jehovah: therefore Jehovah sent lions among them, which killed some of them."
12,17,26,"Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast carried away, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the law of the god of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the law of the god of the land."
12,17,27,"Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the law of the god of the land."
12,17,28,"So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how they should fear Jehovah."
12,17,29,"Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt."
12,17,30,"And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,"
12,17,31,"and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim."
12,17,32,"So they feared Jehovah, and made unto them from among themselves priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places."
12,17,33,"They feared Jehovah, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations from among whom they had been carried away."
12,17,34,"Unto this day they do after the former manner: they fear not Jehovah, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law or after the commandment which Jehovah commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;"
12,17,35,"with whom Jehovah had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:"
12,17,36,"but Jehovah, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm, him shall ye fear, and unto him shall ye bow yourselves, and to him shall ye sacrifice:"
12,17,37,"and the statutes and the ordinances, and the law and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods:"
12,17,38,"and the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods:"
12,17,39,"but Jehovah your God shall ye fear; and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies."
12,17,40,"Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner."
12,17,41,"So these nations feared Jehovah, and served their graven images; their children likewise, and their children's children, as did their fathers, so do they unto this day."
12,18,1,"Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign."
12,18,2,"Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah."
12,18,3,"And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that David his father had done."
12,18,4,"He removed the high places, and brake the pillars, and cut down the Asherah: and he brake in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made; for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it; and he called it Nehushtan."
12,18,5,"He trusted in Jehovah, the God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor `among them' that were before him."
12,18,6,"For he clave to Jehovah; he departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which Jehovah commanded Moses."
12,18,7,"And Jehovah was with him; whithersoever he went forth he prospered: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not."
12,18,8,"He smote the Philistines unto Gaza and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city."
12,18,9,"And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it."
12,18,10,"And at the end of three years they took it: in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken."
12,18,11,"And the king of Assyria carried Israel away unto Assyria, and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,"
12,18,12,"because they obeyed not the voice of Jehovah their God, but transgressed his covenant, even all that Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded, and would not hear it, nor do it."
12,18,13,"Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them."
12,18,14,"And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold."
12,18,15,"And Hezekiah gave `him' all the silver that was found in the house of Jehovah, and in the treasures of the king's house."
12,18,16,"At that time did Hezekiah cut off `the gold from' the doors of the temple of Jehovah, and `from' the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria."
12,18,17,"And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab-saris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army unto Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field."
12,18,18,"And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder."
12,18,19,"And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?"
12,18,20,"Thou sayest (but they are but vain words), `There is' counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou hast rebelled against me?"
12,18,21,"Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him."
12,18,22,"But if ye say unto me, We trust in Jehovah our God; is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?"
12,18,23,"Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them."
12,18,24,"How then canst thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?"
12,18,25,"Am I now come up without Jehovah against this place to destroy it? Jehovah said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it."
12,18,26,"Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not with us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall."
12,18,27,"But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? `hath he' not `sent me' to the men that sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?"
12,18,28,"Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spake, saying, Hear ye the word of the great king, the king of Assyria."
12,18,29,"Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand:"
12,18,30,"neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria."
12,18,31,"Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;"
12,18,32,"Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive-trees and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us."
12,18,33,"Hath any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?"
12,18,34,"Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?"
12,18,35,"Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?"
12,18,36,"But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not."
12,18,37,"Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh."
12,19,1,"And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah."
12,19,2,"And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz."
12,19,3,"And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of contumely; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth."
12,19,4,"It may be Jehovah thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Jehovah thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left."
12,19,5,"So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah."
12,19,6,"And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith Jehovah, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me."
12,19,7,"Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear tidings, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land."
12,19,8,"So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish."
12,19,9,"And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee, he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying,"
12,19,10,"Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria."
12,19,11,"Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?"
12,19,12,"Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar?"
12,19,13,"Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?"
12,19,14,"And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah."
12,19,15,"And Hezekiah prayed before Jehovah, and said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, that sittest `above' the cherubim, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth."
12,19,16,"Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open thine eyes, O Jehovah, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, wherewith he hath sent him to defy the living God."
12,19,17,"Of a truth, Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands,"
12,19,18,"and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them."
12,19,19,"Now therefore, O Jehovah our God, save thou us, I beseech thee, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou Jehovah art God alone."
12,19,20,"Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have heard `thee'."
12,19,21,"This is the word that Jehovah hath spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee."
12,19,22,"Whom hast thou defied and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high? `even' against the Holy One of Israel."
12,19,23,"By thy messengers thou hast defied the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir-trees thereof; and I will enter into his farthest lodging-place, the forest of his fruitful field."
12,19,24,"I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt."
12,19,25,"Hast thou not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? now have I brought it to pass, that it should be thine to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps."
12,19,26,"Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as grain blasted before it is grown up."
12,19,27,"But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against me."
12,19,28,"Because of thy raging against me, and because thine arrogancy is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest."
12,19,29,"And this shall be the sign unto thee: Ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof."
12,19,30,"And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward."
12,19,31,"For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape: the zeal of Jehovah shall perform this."
12,19,32,"Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it."
12,19,33,"By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith Jehovah."
12,19,34,"For I will defend this city to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake."
12,19,35,"And it came to pass that night, that the angel of Jehovah went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies."
12,19,36,"So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh."
12,19,37,"And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead."
12,20,1,"In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Set thy house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live."
12,20,2,"Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto Jehovah, saying,"
12,20,3,"Remember now, O Jehovah, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore."
12,20,4,"And it came to pass, before Isaiah was gone out into the middle part of the city, that the word of Jehovah came to him, saying,"
12,20,5,"Turn back, and say to Hezekiah the prince of my people, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee; on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of Jehovah."
12,20,6,"And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake."
12,20,7,"And Isaiah said, Take a cake of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered."
12,20,8,"And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that Jehovah will heal me, and that I shall go up unto the house of Jehovah the third day?"
12,20,9,"And Isaiah said, This shall be the sign unto thee from Jehovah, that Jehovah will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or go back ten steps?"
12,20,10,"And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to decline ten steps: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten steps."
12,20,11,"And Isaiah the prophet cried unto Jehovah; and he brought the shadow ten steps backward, by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz."
12,20,12,"At that time Berodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick."
12,20,13,"And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not."
12,20,14,"Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon."
12,20,15,"And he said, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them."
12,20,16,"And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah."
12,20,17,"Behold, the days come, that all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith Jehovah."
12,20,18,"And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon."
12,20,19,"Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of Jehovah which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, Is it not so, if peace and truth shall be in my days?"
12,20,20,"Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool, and the conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12,20,21,"And Hezekiah slept with his fathers; and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead."
12,21,1,"Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned five and fifty years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Hephzibah."
12,21,2,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, after the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel."
12,21,3,"For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made an Asherah, as did Ahab king of Israel, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them."
12,21,4,"And he built altars in the house of Jehovah, whereof Jehovah said, In Jerusalem will I put my name."
12,21,5,"And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of Jehovah."
12,21,6,"And he made his son to pass through the fire, and practised augury, and used enchantments, and dealt with them that had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger."
12,21,7,"And he set the graven image of Asherah, that he had made, in the house of which Jehovah said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever;"
12,21,8,"neither will I cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land which I gave their fathers, if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them."
12,21,9,"But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do that which is evil more than did the nations whom Jehovah destroyed before the children of Israel."
12,21,10,"And Jehovah spake by his servants the prophets, saying,"
12,21,11,"Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, that were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols;"
12,21,12,"therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Behold, I bring such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle."
12,21,13,"And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down."
12,21,14,"And I will cast off the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;"
12,21,15,"because they have done that which is evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day."
12,21,16,"Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah."
12,21,17,"Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12,21,18,"And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead."
12,21,19,"Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah."
12,21,20,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did Manasseh his father."
12,21,21,"And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:"
12,21,22,"and he forsook Jehovah, the God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of Jehovah."
12,21,23,"And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and put the king to death in his own house."
12,21,24,"But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead."
12,21,25,"Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12,21,26,"And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead."
12,22,1,"Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath."
12,22,2,"And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left."
12,22,3,"And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of Jehovah, saying,"
12,22,4,"Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of Jehovah, which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people:"
12,22,5,"and let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen that have the oversight of the house of Jehovah; and let them give it to the workmen that are in the house of Jehovah, to repair the breaches of the house,"
12,22,6,"unto the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the house."
12,22,7,"Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand; for they dealt faithfully."
12,22,8,"And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and he read it."
12,22,9,"And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen that have the oversight of the house of Jehovah."
12,22,10,"And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king."
12,22,11,"And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes."
12,22,12,"And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying,"
12,22,13,"Go ye, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us."
12,22,14,"So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter); and they communed with her."
12,22,15,"And she said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Tell ye the man that sent you unto me,"
12,22,16,"Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read."
12,22,17,"Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched."
12,22,18,"But unto the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: As touching the words which thou hast heard,"
12,22,19,"because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before Jehovah, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith Jehovah."
12,22,20,"Therefore, behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again."
12,23,1,"And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem."
12,23,2,"And the king went up to the house of Jehovah, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of Jehovah."
12,23,3,"And the king stood by the pillar, and made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all `his' heart, and all `his' soul, to confirm the words of this covenant that were written in this book: and all the people stood to the covenant."
12,23,4,"And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring forth out of the temple of Jehovah all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the Asherah, and for all the host of heaven, and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Beth-el."
12,23,5,"And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven."
12,23,6,"And he brought out the Asherah from the house of Jehovah, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and beat it to dust, and cast the dust thereof upon the graves of the common people."
12,23,7,"And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were in the house of Jehovah, where the women wove hangings for the Asherah."
12,23,8,"And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beer-sheba; and he brake down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city."
12,23,9,"Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of Jehovah in Jerusalem, but they did eat unleavened bread among their brethren."
12,23,10,"And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech."
12,23,11,"And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of Jehovah, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which was in the precincts; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire."
12,23,12,"And the altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of Jehovah, did the king break down, and beat `them' down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron."
12,23,13,"And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile."
12,23,14,"And he brake in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherim, and filled their places with the bones of men."
12,23,15,"Moreover the altar that was at Beth-el, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he brake down; and he burned the high place and beat it to dust, and burned the Asherah."
12,23,16,"And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount; and he sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of Jehovah which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these things."
12,23,17,"Then he said, What monument is that which I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, who came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Beth-el."
12,23,18,"And he said, Let him be; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria."
12,23,19,"And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke `Jehovah' to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Beth-el."
12,23,20,"And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there, upon the altars, and burned men's bones upon them; and he returned to Jerusalem."
12,23,21,"And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto Jehovah your God, as it is written in this book of the covenant."
12,23,22,"Surely there was not kept such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;"
12,23,23,"but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah was this passover kept to Jehovah in Jerusalem."
12,23,24,"Moreover them that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of Jehovah."
12,23,25,"And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to Jehovah with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him."
12,23,26,"Notwithstanding, Jehovah turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations wherewith Manasseh had provoked him."
12,23,27,"And Jehovah said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and I will cast off this city which I have chosen, even Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there."
12,23,28,"Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12,23,29,"In his days Pharaoh-necoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and `Pharaoh-necoh' slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him."
12,23,30,"And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead."
12,23,31,"Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah."
12,23,32,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that his fathers had done."
12,23,33,"And Pharaoh-necoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold."
12,23,34,"And Pharaoh-necoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim: but he took Jehoahaz away; and he came to Egypt, and died there."
12,23,35,"And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaoh-necoh."
12,23,36,"Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah."
12,23,37,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that his fathers had done."
12,24,1,"In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him."
12,24,2,"And Jehovah sent against him bands of the Chaldeans, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake by his servants the prophets."
12,24,3,"Surely at the commandment of Jehovah came this upon Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did,"
12,24,4,"and also for the innocent blood that he shed; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood: and Jehovah would not pardon."
12,24,5,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12,24,6,"So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers; and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead."
12,24,7,"And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land; for the king of Babylon had taken, from the brook of Egypt unto the river Euphrates, all that pertained to the king of Egypt."
12,24,8,"Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign; and he reigned in Jerusalem three months: and his mother's name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem."
12,24,9,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that his father had done."
12,24,10,"At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged."
12,24,11,"And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came unto the city, while his servants were besieging it;"
12,24,12,"and Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign."
12,24,13,"And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold, which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of Jehovah, as Jehovah had said."
12,24,14,"And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths; none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land."
12,24,15,"And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon; and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the chief men of the land, carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon."
12,24,16,"And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths a thousand, all of them strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon."
12,24,17,"And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, `Jehoiachin's' father's brother, king is his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah."
12,24,18,"Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah."
12,24,19,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that Jehoiakim had done."
12,24,20,"For through the anger of Jehovah did it come to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon."
12,25,1,"And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about."
12,25,2,"So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah."
12,25,3,"On the ninth day of the `fourth' month the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land."
12,25,4,"Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war `fled' by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden (now the Chaldeans were against the city round about); and `the king' went by the way of the Arabah."
12,25,5,"But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him."
12,25,6,"Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him."
12,25,7,"And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon."
12,25,8,"Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem."
12,25,9,"And he burnt the house of Jehovah, and the king's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, burnt he with fire."
12,25,10,"And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were `with' the captain of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about."
12,25,11,"And the residue of the people that were left in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away captive."
12,25,12,"But the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen."
12,25,13,"And the pillars of brass that were in the house of Jehovah, and the bases and the brazen sea that were in the house of Jehovah, did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon."
12,25,14,"And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away."
12,25,15,"And the firepans, and the basins, that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away."
12,25,16,"The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases, which Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah, the brass of all these vessels was without weight."
12,25,17,"The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a capital of brass was upon it; and the height of the capital was three cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capital round about, all of brass: and like unto these had the second pillar with network."
12,25,18,"And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold:"
12,25,19,"and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war; and five men of them that saw the king's face, who were found in the city; and the scribe, the captain of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the city."
12,25,20,"And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah."
12,25,21,"And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land."
12,25,22,"And as for the people that were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor."
12,25,23,"Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men."
12,25,24,"And Gedaliah sware to them and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not because of the servants of the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you."
12,25,25,"But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, so that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah."
12,25,26,"And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces, arose, and came to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans."
12,25,27,"And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;"
12,25,28,"and he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,"
12,25,29,"and changed his prison garments. And `Jehoiachin' did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life:"
12,25,30,"and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him of the king, every day a portion, all the days of his life."

13,9,22,"All these that were chosen to be porters in the thresholds were two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain in their office of trust."
13,9,23,"So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of Jehovah, even the house of the tent, by wards."
13,9,24,"On the four sides were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and south."
13,9,25,"And their brethren, in their villages, were to come in every seven days from time to time to be with them:"
13,9,26,"for the four chief porters, who were Levites, were in an office of trust, and were over the chambers and over the treasuries in the house of God."
13,9,27,"And they lodged round about the house of God, because the charge `thereof' was upon them; and to them pertained the opening thereof morning by morning."
13,9,28,"And certain of them had charge of the vessels of service; for by count were these brought in and by count were these taken out."
13,9,29,"Some of them also were appointed over the furniture, and over all the vessels of the sanctuary, and over the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices."

13,9,33,"And these are the singers, heads of fathers' `houses' of the Levites, `who dwelt' in the chambers `and were' free `from other service'; for they were employed in their work day and night."
13,9,34,"These were heads of fathers' `houses' of the Levites, throughout their generations, chief men: these dwelt at Jerusalem."
13,9,35,"And in Gibeon there dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jeiel, whose wife's name was Maacah:"
13,9,36,"and his first-born son Abdon, and Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab,"
13,9,37,"and Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth."

13,9,43,"and Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son."
13,9,44,"And Azel had six sons, whose names are these: Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan: these were the sons of Azel."
13,10,1,"Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa."
13,10,2,"And the Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul."
13,10,3,"And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was distressed by reason of the archers."
13,10,4,"Then said Saul unto his armor-bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armor-bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it."
13,10,5,"And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died."
13,10,6,"So Saul died, and his three sons; and all his house died together."
13,10,7,"And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them."
13,10,8,"And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa."
13,10,9,"And they stripped him, and took his head, and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the tidings unto their idols, and to the people."
13,10,10,"And they put his armor in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon."
13,10,11,"And when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,"
13,10,12,"all the valiant men arose, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days."
13,10,13,"So Saul died for his trespass which he committed against Jehovah, because of the word of Jehovah, which he kept not; and also for that he asked counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to inquire `thereby',"
13,10,14,"and inquired not of Jehovah: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse."
13,11,1,"Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh."
13,11,2,"In times past, even when Saul was king, it was thou that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and Jehovah thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt be shepherd of my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over my people Israel."
13,11,3,"So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of Jehovah by Samuel."
13,11,4,"And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (the same is Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there."
13,11,5,"And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come in hither. Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David."
13,11,6,"And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief."
13,11,7,"And David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore they called it the city of David."
13,11,8,"And he built the city round about, from Millo even round about; and Joab repaired the rest of the city."
13,11,9,"And David waxed greater and greater; for Jehovah of hosts was with him."
13,11,10,"Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of Jehovah concerning Israel."
13,11,11,"And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them at one time."
13,11,12,"And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men."
13,11,13,"He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines."
13,11,14,"And they stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and Jehovah saved them by a great victory."
13,11,15,"And three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim."
13,11,16,"And David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem."
13,11,17,"And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate!"
13,11,18,"And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto Jehovah,"
13,11,19,"and said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with `the jeopardy of' their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men."
13,11,20,"And Abishai, the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them, and had a name among the three."
13,11,21,"Of the three, he was more honorable than the two, and was made their captain: howbeit he attained not to the `first' three."
13,11,22,"Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he slew the two `sons of' Ariel of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow."
13,11,23,"And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear."
13,11,24,"These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men."
13,11,25,"Behold, he was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to the `first' three: and David set him over his guard."
13,11,26,"Also the mighty men of the armies: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem,"

13,12,1,"Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish; and they were among the mighty men, his helpers in war."
13,12,2,"They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows from the bow: they were of Saul's brethren of Benjamin."
13,12,3,"The chief was Ahiezer; then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite, and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth, and Beracah, and Jehu the Anathothite,"

13,12,14,"These of the sons of Gad were captains of the host: he that was least was equal to a hundred, and the greatest to a thousand."
13,12,15,"These are they that went over the Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west."
13,12,16,"And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the stronghold unto David."
13,12,17,"And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, my heart shall be knit unto you; but if `ye be come' to betray me to mine adversaries, seeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it."
13,12,18,"Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the thirty, `and he said', Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thy helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band."
13,12,19,"Of Manasseh also there fell away some to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not; for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall away to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads."
13,12,20,"As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands that were of Manasseh."
13,12,21,"And they helped David against the band of rovers: for they were all mighty men of valor, and were captains in the host."
13,12,22,"For from day to day men came to David to help him, until there was a great host, like the host of God."
13,12,23,"And these are the numbers of the heads of them that were armed for war, who came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of Jehovah."

13,12,36,"And of Asher, such as were able to go out in the host, that could set the battle in array, forty thousand."
13,12,37,"And on the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half-tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, a hundred and twenty thousand."
13,12,38,"All these being men of war, that could order the battle array, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king."
13,12,39,"And they were there with David three days, eating and drinking; for their brethren had made preparation for them."
13,12,40,"Moreover they that were nigh unto them, `even' as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, victuals of meal, cakes of figs, and clusters of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep in abundance: for there was joy in Israel."
13,13,1,"And David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader."
13,13,2,"And David said unto all the assembly of Israel, If it seem good unto you, and if it be of Jehovah our God, let us send abroad every where unto our brethren that are left in all the land of Israel, with whom the priests and Levites are in their cities that have suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us;"
13,13,3,"and let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we sought not unto it in the days of Saul."
13,13,4,"And all the assembly said that they would do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people."
13,13,5,"So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor `the brook' of Egypt even unto the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim."
13,13,6,"And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, `that is', to Kiriath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God Jehovah that sitteth `above' the cherubim, that is called by the Name."
13,13,7,"And they carried the ark of God upon a new cart, `and brought it' out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart."
13,13,8,"And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, even with songs, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets."
13,13,9,"And when they came unto the threshing-floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled."
13,13,10,"And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put forth his hand to the ark; and there he died before God."
13,13,11,"And David was displeased, because Jehovah had broken forth upon Uzza; and he called that place Perez-uzza, unto this day."
13,13,12,"And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?"
13,13,13,"So David removed not the ark unto him into the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite."
13,13,14,"And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months: and Jehovah blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had."
13,14,1,"And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a house."
13,14,2,"And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king over Israel; for his kingdom was exalted on high, for his people Israel's sake."
13,14,3,"And David took more wives at Jerusalem; and David begat more sons and daughters."
13,14,4,"And these are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,"
13,14,5,"and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,"
13,14,6,"and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,"
13,14,7,"and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet."
13,14,8,"And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David: and David heard of it, and went out against them."
13,14,9,"Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim."
13,14,10,"And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And Jehovah said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thy hand."
13,14,11,"So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and David said, God hath broken mine enemies by my hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim."
13,14,12,"And they left their gods there; and David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire."
13,14,13,"And the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley."
13,14,14,"And David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Thou shalt not go up after them: turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees."
13,14,15,"And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle; for God is gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines."
13,14,16,"And David did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer."
13,14,17,"And the fame of David went out into all lands; and Jehovah brought the fear of him upon all nations."
13,15,1,"And `David' made him houses in the city of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent."
13,15,2,"Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath Jehovah chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever."
13,15,3,"And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Jehovah unto its place, which he had prepared for it."
13,15,4,"And David gathered together the sons of Aaron, and the Levites:"
13,15,5,"of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twenty;"
13,15,6,"of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty;"
13,15,7,"of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and thirty;"
13,15,8,"of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred;"
13,15,9,"of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore;"
13,15,10,"of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twelve."
13,15,11,"And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,"
13,15,12,"and said unto them, Ye are the heads of the fathers' `houses' of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of Jehovah, the God of Israel, unto `the place' that I have prepared for it."
13,15,13,"For because ye `bare it' not at the first, Jehovah our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not according to the ordinance."
13,15,14,"So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Jehovah, the God of Israel."
13,15,15,"And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of Jehovah."
13,15,16,"And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren the singers, with instruments of music, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy."
13,15,17,"So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;"
13,15,18,"and with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers."
13,15,19,"So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, `were appointed' with cymbals of brass to sound aloud;"
13,15,20,"and Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries set to Alamoth;"
13,15,21,"and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps set to the Sheminith, to lead."
13,15,22,"And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the song: he instructed about the song, because he was skilful."
13,15,23,"And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark."
13,15,24,"And Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark."
13,15,25,"So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the house of Obed-edom with joy."
13,15,26,"And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, that they sacrificed seven bullocks and seven rams."
13,15,27,"And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song `with' the singers: and David had upon him an ephod of linen."
13,15,28,"Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with psalteries and harps."
13,15,29,"And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart."
13,16,1,"And they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God."
13,16,2,"And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah."
13,16,3,"And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion `of flesh', and a cake of raisins."
13,16,4,"And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of Jehovah, and to celebrate and to thank and praise Jehovah, the God of Israel:"
13,16,5,"Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with psalteries and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud;"
13,16,6,"and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God."
13,16,7,"Then on that day did David first ordain to give thanks unto Jehovah, by the hand of Asaph and his brethren."
13,16,8,"O give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name; Make known his doings among the peoples."
13,16,9,"Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; Talk ye of all his marvellous works."
13,16,10,"Glory ye in his holy name; Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah."
13,16,11,"Seek ye Jehovah and his strength; Seek his face evermore."
13,16,12,"Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,"
13,16,13,"O ye seed of Israel his servant, Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones."
13,16,14,"He is Jehovah our God; His judgments are in all the earth."
13,16,15,"Remember his covenant for ever, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,"
13,16,16,"`The covenant' which he made with Abraham, And his oath unto Isaac,"
13,16,17,"And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant,"
13,16,18,"Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance;"
13,16,19,"When ye were but a few men in number, Yea, very few, and sojourners in it;"
13,16,20,"And they went about from nation to nation, And from one kingdom to another people."
13,16,21,"He suffered no man to do them wrong; Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,"
13,16,22,"`Saying', Touch not mine anointed ones, And do my prophets no harm."
13,16,23,"Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth; Show forth his salvation from day to day."
13,16,24,"Declare his glory among the nations, His marvellous works among all the peoples."
13,16,25,"For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised: He also is to be feared above all gods."
13,16,26,"For all the gods of the peoples are idols: But Jehovah made the heavens."
13,16,27,"Honor and majesty are before him: Strength and gladness are in his place."
13,16,28,"Ascribe unto Jehovah, ye kindreds of the peoples, Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength;"
13,16,29,"Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name: Bring an offering, and come before him: Worship Jehovah in holy array."
13,16,30,"Tremble before him, all the earth: The world also is established that it cannot be moved."
13,16,31,"Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; And let them say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth."
13,16,32,"Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; Let the field exult, and all that is therein;"
13,16,33,"Then shall the trees of the wood sing for joy before Jehovah; For he cometh to judge the earth."
13,16,34,"O give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness `endureth' for ever."
13,16,35,"And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, And gather us together and deliver us from the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, And to triumph in thy praise."
13,16,36,"Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And all the people said, Amen, and praised Jehovah."
13,16,37,"So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required;"
13,16,38,"and Obed-edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers;"
13,16,39,"and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of Jehovah in the high place that was at Gibeon,"
13,16,40,"to offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah upon the altar of burnt-offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the law of Jehovah, which he commanded unto Israel;"
13,16,41,"and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to Jehovah, because his lovingkindness `endureth' for ever;"
13,16,42,"and with them Heman and Jeduthun `with' trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud, and `with' instruments for the songs of God; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate."
13,16,43,"And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house."
13,17,1,"And it came to pass, when David dwelt in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Jehovah `dwelleth' under curtains."
13,17,2,"And Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thy heart; for God is with thee."
13,17,3,"And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,"
13,17,4,"Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith Jehovah, Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in:"
13,17,5,"for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, unto this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from `one' tabernacle `to another'."
13,17,6,"In all places wherein I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar?"
13,17,7,"Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over my people Israel:"
13,17,8,"and I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth."
13,17,9,"And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first,"
13,17,10,"and `as' from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all thine enemies. Moreover I tell thee that Jehovah will build thee a house."
13,17,11,"And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom."
13,17,12,"He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever."
13,17,13,"I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my lovingkindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee;"
13,17,14,"but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for ever."
13,17,15,"According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David."
13,17,16,"Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Jehovah God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far?"
13,17,17,"And this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; but thou hast spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O Jehovah God."
13,17,18,"What can David `say' yet more unto thee concerning the honor which is done to thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant."
13,17,19,"O Jehovah, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to make known all `these' great things."
13,17,20,"O Jehovah, there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears."
13,17,21,"And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, to make thee a name by great and terrible things, in driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou redeemest out of Egypt?"
13,17,22,"For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, Jehovah, becamest their God."
13,17,23,"And now, O Jehovah, let the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as thou hast spoken."
13,17,24,"And let thy name be established and magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and the house of David thy servant is established before thee."
13,17,25,"For thou, O my God, hast revealed to thy servant that thou wilt build him a house: therefore hath thy servant found `in his heart' to pray before thee."
13,17,26,"And now, O Jehovah, thou art God, and hast promised this good thing unto thy servant:"
13,17,27,"and now it hath pleased thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Jehovah, hast blessed, and it is blessed for ever."
13,18,1,"And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines."
13,18,2,"And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute."
13,18,3,"And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates."
13,18,4,"And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David hocked all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for a hundred chariots."
13,18,5,"And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadarezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men."
13,18,6,"Then David put `garrisons' in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went."
13,18,7,"And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem."
13,18,8,"And from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadarezer, David took very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass."
13,18,9,"And when Tou king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah,"
13,18,10,"he sent Hadoram his son to king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadarezer and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had wars with Tou;) and `he had with him' all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass."
13,18,11,"These also did king David dedicate unto Jehovah, with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek."
13,18,12,"Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah smote of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt eighteen thousand."
13,18,13,"And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became servants to David. And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went."
13,18,14,"And David reigned over all Israel; and he executed justice and righteousness unto all his people."
13,18,15,"And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;"
13,18,16,"and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Shavsha was scribe;"
13,18,17,"and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king."
13,19,1,"And it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead."
13,19,2,"And David said, I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him."
13,19,3,"But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, in that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?"
13,19,4,"So Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away."
13,19,5,"Then there went certain persons, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return."
13,19,6,"And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Arammaacah, and out of Zobah."
13,19,7,"So they hired them thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle."
13,19,8,"And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men."
13,19,9,"And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field."
13,19,10,"Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians."
13,19,11,"And the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon."
13,19,12,"And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me; but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee."
13,19,13,"Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people, and for the cities of our God: and Jehovah do that which seemeth him good."
13,19,14,"So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him."
13,19,15,"And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem."
13,19,16,"And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer at their head."
13,19,17,"And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him."
13,19,18,"And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians `the men of' seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host."
13,19,19,"And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and served him: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more."
13,20,1,"And it came to pass, at the time of the return of the year, at the time when kings go out `to battle', that Joab led forth the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and overthrew it."
13,20,2,"And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much."
13,20,3,"And he brought forth the people that were therein, and cut `them' with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. And thus did David unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem."
13,20,4,"And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines: then Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Sippai, of the sons of the giant; and they were subdued."
13,20,5,"And there was again war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam."
13,20,6,"And there was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six `on each hand', and six `on each foot'; and he also was born unto the giant."
13,20,7,"And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother slew him."
13,20,8,"These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants."
13,21,1,"And Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel."
13,21,2,"And David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know the sum of them."
13,21,3,"And Joab said, Jehovah make his people a hundred times as many as they are: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants? why doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of guilt unto Israel?"
13,21,4,"Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem."
13,21,5,"And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword."
13,21,6,"But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them; for the king's word was abominable to Joab."
13,21,7,"And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel."
13,21,8,"And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing: but now, put away, I beseech thee, the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly."
13,21,9,"And Jehovah spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying,"
13,21,10,"Go and speak unto David, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee."
13,21,11,"So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Take which thou wilt:"
13,21,12,"either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before thy foes, while the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of Jehovah, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of Jehovah destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him that sent me."
13,21,13,"And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Jehovah; for very great are his mercies: and let me not fall into the hand of man."
13,21,14,"So Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men."
13,21,15,"And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was about to destroy, Jehovah beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the destroying angel, It is enough; now stay thy hand. And the angel of Jehovah was standing by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite."
13,21,16,"And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Jehovah standing between earth and heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces."
13,21,17,"And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, O Jehovah my God, be against me, and against my father's house; but not against thy people, that they should be plagued."
13,21,18,"Then the angel of Jehovah commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and rear an altar unto Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite."
13,21,19,"And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of Jehovah."
13,21,20,"And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons that were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat."
13,21,21,"And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground."
13,21,22,"Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing-floor, that I may build thereon an altar unto Jehovah: for the full price shalt thou give it me, that the plague may be stayed from the people."
13,21,23,"And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give `thee' the oxen for burnt-offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal-offering; I give it all."
13,21,24,"And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for Jehovah, nor offer a burnt-offering without cost."
13,21,25,"So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight."
13,21,26,"And David built there an altar unto Jehovah, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon Jehovah; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering."
13,21,27,"And Jehovah commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof."
13,21,28,"At that time, when David saw that Jehovah had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there."
13,21,29,"For the tabernacle of Jehovah, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt-offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon."
13,21,30,"But David could not go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Jehovah."
13,22,1,"Then David said, This is the house of Jehovah God, and this is the altar of burnt-offering for Israel."
13,22,2,"And David commanded to gather together the sojourners that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God."
13,22,3,"And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and brass in abundance without weight;"
13,22,4,"and cedar-trees without number: for the Sidonians and they of Tyre brought cedar-trees in abundance to David."
13,22,5,"And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for Jehovah must be exceeding magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death."
13,22,6,"Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for Jehovah, the God of Israel."
13,22,7,"And David said to Solomon his son, As for me, it was in my heart to build a house unto the name of Jehovah my God."
13,22,8,"But the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build a house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight."
13,22,9,"Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days:"
13,22,10,"he shall build a house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever."
13,22,11,"Now, my son, Jehovah be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of Jehovah thy God, as he hath spoken concerning thee."
13,22,12,"Only Jehovah give thee discretion and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel; that so thou mayest keep the law of Jehovah thy God."
13,22,13,"Then shalt thou prosper, if thou observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Jehovah charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; fear not, neither be dismayed."
13,22,14,"Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Jehovah a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver, and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto."
13,22,15,"Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all men that are skilful in every manner of work:"
13,22,16,"of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and Jehovah be with thee."
13,22,17,"David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, `saying',"
13,22,18,"Is not Jehovah your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on every side? for he hath delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before Jehovah, and before his people."
13,22,19,"Now set your heart and your soul to seek after Jehovah your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of Jehovah God, to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of Jehovah."
13,23,1,"Now David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel."
13,23,2,"And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites."
13,23,3,"And the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand."
13,23,4,"Of these, twenty and four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of Jehovah; and six thousand were officers and judges;"
13,23,5,"and four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand praised Jehovah with the instruments which I made, `said David', to praise therewith."
13,23,6,"And David divided them into courses according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
13,23,7,"Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei."
13,23,8,"The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three."
13,23,9,"The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers' `houses' of Ladan."
13,23,10,"And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei."
13,23,11,"And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they became a fathers' house in one reckoning."
13,23,12,"The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four."
13,23,13,"The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons, for ever, to burn incense before Jehovah, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, for ever."
13,23,14,"But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi."
13,23,15,"The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer."
13,23,16,"The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief."
13,23,17,"And the sons of Eliezer were: Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many."
13,23,18,"The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief."
13,23,19,"The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth."
13,23,20,"The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second."
13,23,21,"The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish."
13,23,22,"And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them `to wife'."
13,23,23,"The sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three."
13,23,24,"These were the sons of Levi after their fathers' houses, even the heads of the fathers' `houses' of those of them that were counted, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of the house of Jehovah, from twenty years old and upward."
13,23,25,"For David said, Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath given rest unto his people; and he dwelleth in Jerusalem for ever:"
13,23,26,"and also the Levites shall no more have need to carry the tabernacle and all the vessels of it for the service thereof."
13,23,27,"For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered, from twenty years old and upward."
13,23,28,"For their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Jehovah, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of the house of God;"
13,23,29,"for the showbread also, and for the fine flour for a meal-offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all manner of measure and size;"
13,23,30,"and to stand every morning to thank and praise Jehovah, and likewise at even;"
13,23,31,"and to offer all burnt-offerings unto Jehovah, on the sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, in number according to the ordinance concerning them, continually before Jehovah;"
13,23,32,"and that they should keep the charge of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, for the service of the house of Jehovah."
13,24,1,"And the courses of the sons of Aaron `were these'. The sons of Aaron: Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar."
13,24,2,"But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's office."
13,24,3,"And David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their ordering in their service."
13,24,4,"And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and `thus' were they divided: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers' houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to their fathers' houses, eight."
13,24,5,"Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for there were princes of the sanctuary, and princes of God, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar."
13,24,6,"And Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, who was of the Levites, wrote them in the presence of the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers' `houses' of the priests and of the Levites; one fathers' house being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar."
13,24,7,"Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,"
13,24,8,"the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,"
13,24,9,"the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,"
13,24,10,"the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,"
13,24,11,"the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,"
13,24,12,"the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,"
13,24,13,"the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,"
13,24,14,"the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,"
13,24,15,"the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,"
13,24,16,"the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,"
13,24,17,"the one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul,"
13,24,18,"the three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah."
13,24,19,"This was the ordering of them in their service, to come into the house of Jehovah according to the ordinance `given' unto them by Aaron their father, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, had commanded him."
13,24,20,"And of the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah."
13,24,21,"Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief."
13,24,22,"Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath."
13,24,23,"And the sons `of Hebron': Jeriah `the chief', Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth."
13,24,24,"The sons of Uzziel, Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir."
13,24,25,"The brother of Micah, Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah."
13,24,26,"The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi; the sons of Jaaziah: Beno."
13,24,27,"The sons of Merari: of Jaaziah, Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri."
13,24,28,"Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons."
13,24,29,"Of Kish; the sons of Kish: Jerahmeel."
13,24,30,"And the sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after their fathers' houses."
13,24,31,"These likewise cast lots even as their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers' `houses' of the priests and of the Levites; the fathers' `houses' of the chief even as those of his younger brother."
13,25,1,"Moreover David and the captains of the host set apart for the service certain of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of them that did the work according to their service was:"
13,25,2,"of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asharelah, the sons of Asaph, under the hand of Asaph, who prophesied after the order of the king."
13,25,3,"Of Jeduthun; the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun with the harp, who prophesied in giving thanks and praising Jehovah."
13,25,4,"Of Heman; the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, Mahazioth."
13,25,5,"All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters."
13,25,6,"All these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of Jehovah, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the house of God; Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman being under the order of the king."
13,25,7,"And the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed in singing unto Jehovah, even all that were skilful, was two hundred fourscore and eight."
13,25,8,"And they cast lots for their offices, all alike, as well the small as the great, the teacher as the scholar."
13,25,9,"Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph: the second to Gedaliah; he and his brethren and sons were twelve:"
13,25,10,"the third to Zaccur, his sons and his brethren, twelve:"
13,25,11,"the fourth to Izri, his sons and his brethren, twelve:"

13,25,22,"for the fifteenth to Jeremoth, his sons and his brethren, twelve:"
13,25,23,"for the sixteenth to Hananiah, his sons and his brethren, twelve:"
13,25,24,"for the seventeenth to Joshbekashah, his sons and his brethren, twelve:"
13,25,25,"for the eighteenth to Hanani, his sons and his brethren, twelve:"
13,25,26,"for the nineteenth to Mallothi, his sons and his brethren, twelve:"
13,25,27,"for the twentieth to Eliathah, his sons and his brethren, twelve:"
13,25,28,"for the one and twentieth to Hothir, his sons and his brethren, twelve:"
13,25,29,"for the two and twentieth to Giddalti, his sons and his brethren, twelve:"
13,25,30,"for the three and twentieth to Mahazioth, his sons and his brethren, twelve:"
13,25,31,"for the four and twentieth to Romamtiezer, his sons and his brethren, twelve."
13,26,1,"For the courses of the doorkeepers: of the Korahites, Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph."
13,26,2,"And Meshelemiah had sons: Zechariah the first-born, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,"
13,26,3,"Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Eliehoenai the seventh."
13,26,4,"And Obed-edom had sons: Shemaiah the first-born, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, and Sacar the fourth, and Nethanel the fifth,"
13,26,5,"Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peullethai the eighth; for God blessed him."
13,26,6,"Also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born, that ruled over the house of their father; for they were mighty men of valor."
13,26,7,"The sons of Shemaiah: Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad, whose brethren were valiant men, Elihu, and Semachiah."
13,26,8,"All these were of the sons of Obed-edom: they and their sons and their brethren, able men in strength for the service; threescore and two of Obed-edom."
13,26,9,"And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren, valiant men, eighteen."
13,26,10,"Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons: Shimri the chief, (for though he was not the first-born, yet his father made him chief),"
13,26,11,"Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth: all the sons and brethren of Hosah were thirteen."
13,26,12,"Of these were the courses of the doorkeepers, even of the chief men, having offices like their brethren, to minister in the house of Jehovah."
13,26,13,"And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according to their fathers' houses, for every gate."
13,26,14,"And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a discreet counsellor, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward."
13,26,15,"To Obed-edom southward; and to his sons the store-house."
13,26,16,"To Shuppim and Hosah westward, by the gate of Shallecheth, at the causeway that goeth up, watch against watch."
13,26,17,"Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward four a day, and for the store-house two and two."
13,26,18,"For Parbar westward, four at the causeway, and two at Parbar."
13,26,19,"These were the courses of the doorkeepers; of the sons of the Korahites, and of the sons of Merari."
13,26,20,"And of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of the house of God, and over the treasures of the dedicated things."
13,26,21,"The sons of Ladan, the sons of the Gershonites belonging to Ladan, the heads of the fathers' `houses' belonging to Ladan the Gershonite: Jehieli."
13,26,22,"The sons of Jehieli: Zetham, and Joel his brother, over the treasures of the house of Jehovah."
13,26,23,"Of the Amramites, of the Izharites, of the Hebronites, of the Uzzielites:"
13,26,24,"and Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler over the treasures."
13,26,25,"And his brethren: of Eliezer `came' Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomoth his son."
13,26,26,"This Shelomoth and his brethren were over all the treasures of the dedicated things, which David the king, and the heads of the fathers' `houses', the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the host, had dedicated."
13,26,27,"Out of the spoil won in battles did they dedicate to repair the house of Jehovah."
13,26,28,"And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had dedicated, whosoever had dedicated anything, it was under the hand of Shelomoth, and of his brethren."
13,26,29,"Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were for the outward business over Israel, for officers and judges."
13,26,30,"Of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brethren, men of valor, a thousand and seven hundred, had the oversight of Israel beyond the Jordan westward, for all the business of Jehovah, and for the service of the king."
13,26,31,"Of the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even of the Hebronites, according to their generations by fathers' `houses'. In the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for, and there were found among them mighty men of valor at Jazer of Gilead."
13,26,32,"And his brethren, men of valor, were two thousand and seven hundred, heads of fathers' `houses', whom king David made overseers over the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of the Manassites, for every matter pertaining to God, and for the affairs of the king."
13,27,1,"Now the children of Israel after their number, `to wit', the heads of fathers' `houses' and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and their officers that served the king, in any matter of the courses which came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year-of every course were twenty and four thousand."
13,27,2,"Over the first course for the first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel: and in his course were twenty and four thousand."
13,27,3,"`He was' of the children of Perez, the chief of all the captains of the host for the first month."

13,27,7,"The fourth `captain' for the fourth month was Asahel the brother of Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him: and in his course were twenty and four thousand."
13,27,8,"The fifth captain for this fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite: and in his course were twenty and four thousand."
13,27,9,"The sixth `captain' for the sixth month was Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite: and in his course were twenty and four thousand."

13,27,15,"The twelfth `captain' for the twelfth month was Heldai the Netophathite, of Othniel: and in his course were twenty and four thousand."
13,27,16,"Furthermore over the tribes of Israel: of the Reubenites was Eliezer the son of Zichri the ruler: of the Simeonites, Shephatiah the son of Maacah:"
13,27,17,"of Levi, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel: of Aaron, Zadok:"
13,27,18,"of Judah, Elihu, one of the brethren of David: of Issachar, Omri the son of Michael:"

13,27,22,"of Dan, Azarel the son of Jeroham. These were the captains of the tribes of Israel."
13,27,23,"But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under, because Jehovah had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of heaven."
13,27,24,"Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but finished not; and there came wrath for this upon Israel; neither was the number put into the account in the chronicles of king David."
13,27,25,"And over the king's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the treasures in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the castles, was Jonathan the son of Uzziah:"
13,27,26,"And over them that did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub:"
13,27,27,"and over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: and over the increase of the vineyards for the wine-cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite:"
13,27,28,"and over the olive-trees and the sycomore-trees that were in the lowland was Baal-hanan the Gederite: and over the cellars of oil was Joash:"
13,27,29,"and over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai:"
13,27,30,"and over the camels was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite: and over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagrite."
13,27,31,"All these were the rulers of the substance which was king David's."
13,27,32,"Also Jonathan, David's uncle, was a counsellor, a man of understanding, and a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king's sons:"
13,27,33,"And Ahithophel was the king's counsellor: and Hushai the Archite was the king's friend:"
13,27,34,"and after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar: and the captain of the king's host was Joab."
13,28,1,"And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that served the king by course, and the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, and the rulers over all the substance and possessions of the king and of his sons, with the officers, and the mighty men, even all the mighty men of valor, unto Jerusalem."
13,28,2,"Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: as for me, it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and for the footstool of our God; and I had made ready for the building."
13,28,3,"But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build a house for my name, because thou art a man of war, and hast shed blood."
13,28,4,"Howbeit Jehovah, the God of Israel, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah to be prince; and in the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel;"
13,28,5,"And of all my sons (for Jehovah hath given me many sons), he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of Jehovah over Israel."
13,28,6,"And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father."
13,28,7,"And I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and mine ordinances, as at this day."
13,28,8,"Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of Jehovah, and in the audience of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of Jehovah your God; that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you for ever."
13,28,9,"And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for Jehovah searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever."
13,28,10,"Take heed now; for Jehovah hath chosen thee to build a house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it."
13,28,11,"Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch `of the temple', and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper rooms thereof, and of the inner chambers thereof, and of the place of the mercy-seat;"
13,28,12,"and the pattern of all that he had by the Spirit, for the courts of the house of Jehovah, and for all the chambers round about, for the treasuries of the house of God, and for the treasuries of the dedicated things;"
13,28,13,"also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of Jehovah, and for all the vessels of service in the house of Jehovah;"
13,28,14,"of gold by weight for the `vessels of' gold, for all vessels of every kind of service; `of silver' for all the vessels of silver by weight, for all vessels of every kind of service;"
13,28,15,"by weight also for the candlesticks of gold, and for the lamps thereof, of gold, by weight for every candlestick and for the lamps thereof; and for the candlesticks of silver, `silver' by weight for `every' candlestick and for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick;"
13,28,16,"and the gold by weight for the tables of showbread, for every table; and silver for the tables of silver;"
13,28,17,"and the flesh-hooks, and the basins, and the cups, of pure gold; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl; and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl;"
13,28,18,"and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot, `even' the cherubim, that spread out `their wings', and covered the ark of the covenant of Jehovah."
13,28,19,"All this, `said David', have I been made to understand in writing from the hand of Jehovah, even all the works of this pattern."
13,28,20,"And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed; for Jehovah God, even my God, is with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until all the work for the service of the house of Jehovah be finished."
13,28,21,"And, behold, there are the courses of the priests and the Levites, for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with thee in all manner of work every willing man that hath skill, for any manner of service: also the captains and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment."
13,29,1,"And David the king said unto all the assembly, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great; for the palace is not for man, but for Jehovah God."
13,29,2,"Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for the `things of' gold, and the silver for the `things of' silver, and the brass for the `things of' brass, the iron for the `things of' iron, and wood for the `things of' wood; onyx stones, and `stones' to be set, stones for inlaid work, and of divers colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance."
13,29,3,"Moreover also, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, seeing that I have a treasure of mine own of gold and silver, I give it unto the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,"
13,29,4,"even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, wherewith to overlay the walls of the houses;"
13,29,5,"of gold for the `things of' gold, and of silver for the `things of' silver, and for all manner of work `to be made' by the hands of artificers. Who then offereth willingly to consecrate himself this day unto Jehovah?"
13,29,6,"Then the princes of the fathers' `houses', and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king's work, offered willingly;"
13,29,7,"and they gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and of iron a hundred thousand talents."
13,29,8,"And they with whom `precious' stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of Jehovah, under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite."
13,29,9,"Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Jehovah: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy."
13,29,10,"Wherefore David blessed Jehovah before all the assembly; and David said, Blessed be thou, O Jehovah, the God of Israel our father, for ever and ever."
13,29,11,"Thine, O Jehovah, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heavens and in the earth `is thine'; thine is the kingdom, O Jehovah, and thou art exalted as head above all."
13,29,12,"Both riches and honor come of thee, and thou rulest over all; and in thy hand is power and might; and in thy hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all."
13,29,13,"Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name."
13,29,14,"But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee."
13,29,15,"For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as all our fathers were: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no abiding."
13,29,16,"O Jehovah our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee a house for thy holy name cometh of thy hand, and is all thine own."
13,29,17,"I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, that are present here, offer willingly unto thee."
13,29,18,"O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee;"
13,29,19,"and give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision."
13,29,20,"And David said to all the assembly, Now bless Jehovah your God. And all the assembly blessed Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped Jehovah, and the king."
13,29,21,"And they sacrificed sacrifices unto Jehovah, and offered burnt-offerings unto Jehovah, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink-offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel,"
13,29,22,"and did eat and drink before Jehovah on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto Jehovah to be prince, and Zadok to be priest."
13,29,23,"Then Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him."
13,29,24,"And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king."
13,29,25,"And Jehovah magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel."
13,29,26,"Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel."
13,29,27,"And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three `years' reigned he in Jerusalem."
13,29,28,"And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead."
13,29,29,"Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,"
13,29,30,"with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries."
14,1,1,"And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and Jehovah his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly."
14,1,2,"And Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers' `houses'."
14,1,3,"So Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of Jehovah had made in the wilderness."
14,1,4,"But the ark of God had David brought up from Kiriath-jearim to `the place' that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem."
14,1,5,"Moreover the brazen altar, that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of Jehovah: and Solomon and the assembly sought unto it."
14,1,6,"And Solomon went up thither to the brazen altar before Jehovah, which was at the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt-offerings upon it."
14,1,7,"In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee."
14,1,8,"And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast showed great lovingkindness unto David my father, and hast made me king in his stead."
14,1,9,"Now, O Jehovah God, let thy promise unto David my father be established; for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude."
14,1,10,"Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?"
14,1,11,"And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of them that hate thee, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:"
14,1,12,"wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee; neither shall there any after thee have the like."
14,1,13,"So Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, unto Jerusalem; and he reigned over Israel."
14,1,14,"And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem."
14,1,15,"And the king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance."
14,1,16,"And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; the king's merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price."
14,1,17,"And they fetched up and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred `shekels' of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means."
14,2,1,"Now Solomon purposed to build a house for the name of Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom."
14,2,2,"And Solomon counted out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand men that were hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them."
14,2,3,"And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him a house to dwell therein, `even so deal with me'."
14,2,4,"Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him incense of sweet spices, and for the continual showbread, and for the burnt-offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Jehovah our God. This is `an ordinance' for ever to Israel."
14,2,5,"And the house which I build is great; for great is our God above all gods."
14,2,6,"But who is able to build him a house, seeing heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him a house, save only to burn incense before him?"
14,2,7,"Now therefore send me a man skilful to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that knoweth how to grave `all manner of' gravings, `to be' with the skilful men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide."
14,2,8,"Send me also cedar-trees, fir-trees, and algum-trees, out of Lebanon; for I know that thy servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon: and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,"
14,2,9,"even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful."
14,2,10,"And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil."
14,2,11,"Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because Jehovah loveth his people, he hath made thee king over them."
14,2,12,"Huram said moreover, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with discretion and understanding, that should build a house for Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom."
14,2,13,"And now I have sent a skilful man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's,"
14,2,14,"the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan; and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson, also to grave any manner of graving, and to devise any device; that there may be `a place' appointed unto him with thy skilful men, and with the skilful men of my lord David thy father."
14,2,15,"Now therefore the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:"
14,2,16,"and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need; and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem."
14,2,17,"And Solomon numbered all the sojourners that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found a hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred."
14,2,18,"And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand that were hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people at work."
14,3,1,"Then Solomon began to build the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem on mount Moriah, where `Jehovah' appeared unto David his father, which he made ready in the place that David had appointed, in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite."
14,3,2,"And he began to build in the second `day' of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign."
14,3,3,"Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits."
14,3,4,"And the porch that was before `the house', the length of it, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the height a hundred and twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold."
14,3,5,"And the greater house he ceiled with fir-wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and wrought thereon palm-trees and chains."
14,3,6,"And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim."
14,3,7,"He overlaid also the house, the beams, the thresholds, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubim on the walls."
14,3,8,"And he made the most holy house: the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents."
14,3,9,"And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold."
14,3,10,"And in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work; and they overlaid them with gold."
14,3,11,"And the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: the wing of the one `cherub' was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was `likewise' five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub."
14,3,12,"And the wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits `also', joining to the wing of the other cherub."
14,3,13,"The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were toward the house."
14,3,14,"And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubim thereon."
14,3,15,"Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits."
14,3,16,"And he made chains in the oracle, and put `them' on the tops of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains."
14,3,17,"And he set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz."
14,4,1,"Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof."
14,4,2,"Also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass; and the height thereof was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about."
14,4,3,"And under it was the likeness of oxen, which did compass it round about, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast."
14,4,4,"It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward."
14,4,5,"And it was a handbreadth thick; and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it received and held three thousand baths."
14,4,6,"He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as belonged to the burnt-offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in."
14,4,7,"And he made the ten candlesticks of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left."
14,4,8,"He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made a hundred basins of gold."
14,4,9,"Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass."
14,4,10,"And he set the sea on the right side `of the house' eastward, toward the south."
14,4,11,"And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. So Huram made an end of doing the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of God:"
14,4,12,"the two pillars, and the bowls, and the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars,"
14,4,13,"and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars."
14,4,14,"He made also the bases, and the lavers made he upon the bases;"
14,4,15,"one sea, and the twelve oxen under it."
14,4,16,"The pots also, and the shovels, and the flesh-hooks, and all the vessels thereof, did Huram his father make for king Solomon for the house of Jehovah of bright brass."
14,4,17,"In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah."
14,4,18,"Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out."
14,4,19,"And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon was the showbread;"
14,4,20,"and the candlesticks with their lamps, to burn according to the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold;"
14,4,21,"and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold, and that perfect gold;"
14,4,22,"and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the firepans, of pure gold: and as for the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the house, `to wit', of the temple, were of gold."
14,5,1,"Thus all the work that Solomon wrought for the house of Jehovah was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, even the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of God."
14,5,2,"Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers' `houses' of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zion."
14,5,3,"nd all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king at the feast, which was `in' the seventh month."
14,5,4,"And all the elders of Israel came: and the Levites took up the ark;"
14,5,5,"and they brought up the ark, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; these did the priests the Levites bring up."
14,5,6,"And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude."
14,5,7,"And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah unto its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim."
14,5,8,"For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above."
14,5,9,"And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without: and there it is unto this day."
14,5,10,"There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put `there' at Horeb, when Jehovah made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt."
14,5,11,"And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, (for all the priests that were present had sanctified themselves, and did not keep their courses;"
14,5,12,"also the Levites who were the singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brethren, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets;)"
14,5,13,"it came to pass, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking Jehovah; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised Jehovah, `saying', For he is good; for his lovingkindness `endureth' for ever; that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of Jehovah,"
14,5,14,"so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of God."
14,6,1,"Then spake Solomon, Jehovah hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness."
14,6,2,"But I have built thee a house of habitation, and a place for thee to dwell in for ever."
14,6,3,"And the king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood."
14,6,4,"And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hands fulfilled it, saying,"
14,6,5,"Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be prince over my people Israel:"
14,6,6,"but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel."
14,6,7,"Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel."
14,6,8,"But Jehovah said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart:"
14,6,9,"nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name."
14,6,10,"And Jehovah hath performed his word that he spake; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and have built the house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel."
14,6,11,"And there have I set the ark, wherein is the covenant of Jehovah, which he made with the children of Israel."
14,6,12,"And he stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands;"
14,6,13,"(for Solomon had made a brazen scaffold, five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;)"
14,6,14,"and he said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven, or on earth; who keepest covenant and lovingkindness with thy servants, that walk before thee with all their heart;"
14,6,15,"who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him: yea, thou spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day."
14,6,16,"Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk in my law as thou hast walked before me."
14,6,17,"Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David."
14,6,18,"But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have builded!"
14,6,19,"Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee;"
14,6,20,"that thine eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place."
14,6,21,"And hearken thou to the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: yea, hear thou from thy dwelling-place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest forgive."
14,6,22,"If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and he come `and' swear before thine altar in this house;"
14,6,23,"then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, requiting the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness."
14,6,24,"And if thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;"
14,6,25,"then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers."
14,6,26,"When the heavens are shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them:"
14,6,27,"then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance."
14,6,28,"If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague or whatsoever sickness there be;"
14,6,29,"what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, who shall know every man his own plague and his own sorrow, and shall spread forth his hands toward this house:"
14,6,30,"then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling-place and forgive, and render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of the children of men;)"
14,6,31,"that they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers."
14,6,32,"Moreover concerning the foreigner, that is not of thy people Israel, when he shall come from a far country for thy great name's sake, and thy mighty hand, and thine outstretched arm; when they shall come and pray toward this house:"
14,6,33,"then hear thou from heaven, even from thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the foreigner calleth to thee for; that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name."
14,6,34,"If thy people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatsoever way thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name;"
14,6,35,"then hear thou from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause."
14,6,36,"If they sin against thee (for there is no man that sinneth not), and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive unto a land far off or near;"
14,6,37,"yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have dealt wickedly;"
14,6,38,"if they return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captive, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name:"
14,6,39,"then hear thou from heaven, even from thy dwelling-place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee."
14,6,40,"Now, O my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be attent, unto the prayer that is made in this place."
14,6,41,"Now therefore arise, O Jehovah God, into thy resting-place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O Jehovah God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness."
14,6,42,"O Jehovah God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember `thy' lovingkindnesses to David thy servant."
14,7,1,"Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt-offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of Jehovah filled the house."
14,7,2,"And the priests could not enter into the house of Jehovah, because the glory of Jehovah filled Jehovah's house."
14,7,3,"And all the children of Israel looked on, when the fire came down, and the glory of Jehovah was upon the house; and they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and gave thanks unto Jehovah, `saying', For he is good; for his lovingkindness `endureth' for ever."
14,7,4,"Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before Jehovah."
14,7,5,"And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God."
14,7,6,"And the priests stood, according to their offices; the Levites also with instruments of music of Jehovah, which David the king had made to give thanks unto Jehovah, (for his lovingkindness `endureth' for ever,) when David praised by their ministry: and the priests sounded trumpets before them; and all Israel stood."
14,7,7,"Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah; for there he offered the burnt-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat."
14,7,8,"So Solomon held the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt."
14,7,9,"And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days."
14,7,10,"And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away unto their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that Jehovah had showed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people."
14,7,11,"Thus Solomon finished the house of Jehovah, and the king's house: and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of Jehovah, and in his own house, he prosperously effected."
14,7,12,"And Jehovah appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice."
14,7,13,"If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;"
14,7,14,"if my people, who are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land."
14,7,15,"Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent, unto the prayer that is made in this place."
14,7,16,"For now have I chosen and hallowed this house, that my name may be there for ever; and mine eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually."
14,7,17,"And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and mine ordinances;"
14,7,18,"then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel."
14,7,19,"But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;"
14,7,20,"then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples."
14,7,21,"And this house, which is so high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall say, Why hath Jehovah done thus unto this land, and to this house?"
14,7,22,"And they shall answer, Because they forsook Jehovah, the God of their fathers, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them."
14,8,1,"And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of Jehovah, and his own house,"
14,8,2,"that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there."
14,8,3,"And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it."
14,8,4,"And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store-cities, which he built in Hamath."
14,8,5,"Also he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars;"
14,8,6,"and Baalath, and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion."
14,8,7,"As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, that were not of Israel;"
14,8,8,"of their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, of them did Solomon raise a levy `of bondservants' unto this day."
14,8,9,"But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen."
14,8,10,"And these were the chief officers of king Solomon, even two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people."
14,8,11,"And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her; for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of Jehovah hath come."
14,8,12,"Then Solomon offered burnt-offerings unto Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah, which he had built before the porch,"
14,8,13,"even as the duty of every day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts, three times in the year, `even' in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles."
14,8,14,"And he appointed, according to the ordinance of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their offices, to praise, and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required; the doorkeepers also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded."
14,8,15,"And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures."
14,8,16,"Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of Jehovah, and until it was finished. `So' the house of Jehovah was completed."
14,8,17,"Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, on the seashore in the land of Edom."
14,8,18,"And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and fetched from thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon."
14,9,1,"And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great train, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart."
14,9,2,"And Solomon told her all her questions; and there was not anything hid from Solomon which he told her not."
14,9,3,"And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,"
14,9,4,"and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, his cupbearers also, and their apparel, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of Jehovah; there was no more spirit in her."
14,9,5,"And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom."
14,9,6,"Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it; and, behold, the half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: thou exceedest the fame that I heard."
14,9,7,"Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, that stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom."
14,9,8,"Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on his throne, to be king for Jehovah thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do justice and righteousness."
14,9,9,"And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon."
14,9,10,"And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, that brought gold from Ophir, brought algum-trees and precious stones."
14,9,11,"And the king made of the algum-trees terraces for the house of Jehovah, and for the king's house, and harps and psalteries for the singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah."
14,9,12,"And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, besides that which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants."
14,9,13,"Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold,"
14,9,14,"besides that which the traders and merchants brought: and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon."
14,9,15,"And king Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred `shekels' of beaten gold went to one buckler."
14,9,16,"And `he made' three hundred shields of beaten gold; three hundred `shekels' of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon."
14,9,17,"Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold."
14,9,18,"nd there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays."
14,9,19,"And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom."
14,9,20,"And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: silver was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon."
14,9,21,"For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years came the ships of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks."
14,9,22,"So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom."
14,9,23,"And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart."
14,9,24,"And they brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year."
14,9,25,"And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem."
14,9,26,"And he ruled over all the kings from the River even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt."
14,9,27,"And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance."
14,9,28,"And they brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt, and out of all lands."
14,9,29,"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?"
14,9,30,"And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years."
14,9,31,"And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead."
14,10,1,"And Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king."
14,10,2,"And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it, (for he was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of king Solomon,) that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt."
14,10,3,"And they sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spake to Rehoboam, saying,"
14,10,4,"Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee."
14,10,5,"And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed."
14,10,6,"And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?"
14,10,7,"And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever."
14,10,8,"But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him, that stood before him."
14,10,9,"And he said unto them, What counsel give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter?"
14,10,10,"And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou say unto the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger is thicker than my father's loins."
14,10,11,"And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I `will chastise you' with scorpions."
14,10,12,"So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day."
14,10,13,"And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,"
14,10,14,"and spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I `will chastise you' with scorpions."
14,10,15,"So the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was brought about of God, that Jehovah might establish his word, which he spake by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat."
14,10,16,"And when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So all Israel departed unto their tents."
14,10,17,"But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them."
14,10,18,"Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject to taskwork; and the children of Israel stoned him to death with stones. And king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem."
14,10,19,"So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day."
14,11,1,"And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, that were warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam."
14,11,2,"But the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,"
14,11,3,"Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,"
14,11,4,"Thus saith Jehovah, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house; for this thing is of me. So they hearkened unto the words of Jehovah, and returned from going against Jeroboam."
14,11,5,"And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah."
14,11,6,"He built Beth-lehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,"
14,11,7,"And Beth-zur, and Soco, and Adullam,"
14,11,8,"and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,"
14,11,9,"and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,"
14,11,10,"and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities."
14,11,11,"And he fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of victuals, and oil and wine."
14,11,12,"And in every city `he put' shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong. And Judah and Benjamin belonged to him."
14,11,13,"And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their border."
14,11,14,"For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest's office unto Jehovah;"
14,11,15,"and he appointed him priests for the high places, and for the he-goats, and for the calves which he had made."
14,11,16,"And after them, out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice unto Jehovah, the God of their fathers."
14,11,17,"So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years; for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon."
14,11,18,"And Rehoboam took him a wife, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, `and of' Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;"
14,11,19,"and she bare him sons: Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham."
14,11,20,"And after her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom; and she bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith."
14,11,21,"And Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines, and begat twenty and eight sons and threescore daughters.)"
14,11,22,"And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, `even' the prince among his brethren; for `he was minded' to make him king."
14,11,23,"And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fortified city: and he gave them victuals in abundance. And he sought `for them' many wives."
14,12,1,"And it came to pass, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established, and he was strong, that he forsook the law of Jehovah, and all Israel with him."
14,12,2,"And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had trespassed against Jehovah,"
14,12,3,"with twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen. And the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians."
14,12,4,"And he took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah, and came unto Jerusalem."
14,12,5,"Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, Ye have forsaken me, therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak."
14,12,6,"Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, Jehovah is righteous."
14,12,7,"And when Jehovah saw that they humbled themselves, the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves: I will not destroy them; but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak."
14,12,8,"Nevertheless they shall be his servants, that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries."
14,12,9,"So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king's house: he took all away: he took away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made."
14,12,10,"And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, that kept the door of the king's house."
14,12,11,"And it was so, that, as oft as the king entered into the house of Jehovah, the guard came and bare them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber."
14,12,12,"And when he humbled himself, the wrath of Jehovah turned from him, so as not to destroy him altogether: and moreover in Judah there were good things `found'."
14,12,13,"So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there: and his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess."
14,12,14,"And he did that which was evil, because he set not his heart to seek Jehovah."
14,12,15,"Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, after the manner of genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually."
14,12,16,"And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead."
14,13,1,"In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah."
14,13,2,"Three years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam."
14,13,3,"And Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor."
14,13,4,"And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel:"
14,13,5,"Ought ye not to know that Jehovah, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?"
14,13,6,"Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord."
14,13,7,"And there were gathered unto him worthless men, base fellows, that strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could not withstand them."
14,13,8,"And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David; and ye are a great multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods."
14,13,9,"Have ye not driven out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made you priests after the manner of the peoples of `other' lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of `them that are' no gods."
14,13,10,"But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and `we have' priests ministering unto Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work:"
14,13,11,"and they burn unto Jehovah every morning and every evening burnt-offerings and sweet incense: the showbread also `set they' in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of Jehovah our God; but ye have forsaken him."
14,13,12,"And, behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against Jehovah, the God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper."
14,13,13,"But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them."
14,13,14,"And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried unto Jehovah, and the priests sounded with the trumpets."
14,13,15,"Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah."
14,13,16,"And the children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand."
14,13,17,"And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men."
14,13,18,"Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon Jehovah, the God of their fathers."
14,13,19,"And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephron with the towns thereof."
14,13,20,"Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and Jehovah smote him, and he died."
14,13,21,"But Abijah waxed mighty, and took unto himself fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters."
14,13,22,"And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo."
14,14,1,"So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years."
14,14,2,"And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of Jehovah his God:"
14,14,3,"for he took away the foreign altars, and the high places, and brake down the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim,"
14,14,4,"and commanded Judah to seek Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment."
14,14,5,"Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun-images: and the kingdom was quiet before him."
14,14,6,"And he built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Jehovah had given him rest."
14,14,7,"For he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars; the land is yet before us, because we have sought Jehovah our God; we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered."
14,14,8,"And Asa had an army that bare bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor."
14,14,9,"And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and he came unto Mareshah."
14,14,10,"Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah."
14,14,11,"And Asa cried unto Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, there is none besides thee to help, between the mighty and him that hath no strength: help us, O Jehovah our God; for we rely on thee, and in thy name are we come against this multitude. O Jehovah, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee."
14,14,12,"So Jehovah smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled."
14,14,13,"And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Jehovah, and before his host; and they carried away very much booty."
14,14,14,"And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of Jehovah came upon them: and they despoiled all the cities; for there was much spoil in them."
14,14,15,"They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem."
14,15,1,"And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:"
14,15,2,"and he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: Jehovah is with you, while ye are with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you."
14,15,3,"Now for a long season Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law:"
14,15,4,"But when in their distress they turned unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them."
14,15,5,"And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in; but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the lands."
14,15,6,"And they were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city against city; for God did vex them with all adversity."
14,15,7,"But be ye strong, and let not your hands be slack; for your work shall be rewarded."
14,15,8,"And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill-country of Ephraim; and he renewed the altar of Jehovah, that was before the porch of Jehovah."
14,15,9,"And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and them that sojourned with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that Jehovah his God was with him."
14,15,10,"So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa."
14,15,11,"And they sacrificed unto Jehovah in that day, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep."
14,15,12,"And they entered into the covenant to seek Jehovah, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul;"
14,15,13,"and that whosoever would not seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman."
14,15,14,"And they sware unto Jehovah with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets."
14,15,15,"And all Judah rejoiced at the oath; for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and Jehovah gave them rest round about."
14,15,16,"And also Maacah, the mother of Asa the king, he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and made dust of it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron."
14,15,17,"But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days."
14,15,18,"And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels."
14,15,19,"And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa."
14,16,1,"In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah."
14,16,2,"Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of Jehovah and of the king's house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,"
14,16,3,"`There is' a league between me and thee, as `there was' between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me."
14,16,4,"And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store-cities of Naphtali."
14,16,5,"And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building Ramah, and let his work cease."
14,16,6,"Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah."
14,16,7,"And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and hast not relied on Jehovah thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thy hand."
14,16,8,"Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge host, with chariots and horsemen exceeding many? yet, because thou didst rely on Jehovah, he delivered them into thy hand."
14,16,9,"For the eyes of Jehovah run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly; for from henceforth thou shalt have wars."
14,16,10,"Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in the prison-house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time."
14,16,11,"And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel."
14,16,12,"And in the thirty and ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet; his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to Jehovah, but to the physicians."
14,16,13,"And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign."
14,16,14,"And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had hewn out for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and divers kinds `of spices' prepared by the perfumers' art: and they made a very great burning for him."
14,17,1,"And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel."
14,17,2,"And he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken."
14,17,3,"And Jehovah was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto the Baalim,"
14,17,4,"but sought to the God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel."
14,17,5,"Therefore Jehovah established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat tribute; and he had riches and honor in abundance."
14,17,6,"And his heart was lifted up in the ways of Jehovah: and furthermore he took away the high places and the Asherim out of Judah."
14,17,7,"Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Ben-hail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;"
14,17,8,"and with them the Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests."
14,17,9,"And they taught in Judah, having the book of the law of Jehovah with them; and they went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught among the people."
14,17,10,"And the fear of Jehovah fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat."
14,17,11,"And some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and silver for tribute; the Arabians also brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he-goats."
14,17,12,"And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles and cities of store."
14,17,13,"And he had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem."
14,17,14,"And this was the numbering of them according to their fathers' houses: Of Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand;"
14,17,15,"and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand;"
14,17,16,"and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto Jehovah; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor."
14,17,17,"And of Benjamin: Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield;"
14,17,18,"and next to him Jehozabad and with him a hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for war."
14,17,19,"These were they that waited on the king, besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah."
14,18,1,"Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance; and he joined affinity with Ahab."
14,18,2,"And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that were with him, and moved him to go up `with him' to Ramoth-gilead."
14,18,3,"And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and `we will be' with thee in the war."
14,18,4,"And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire first, I pray thee, for the word of Jehovah."
14,18,5,"Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the hand of the king."
14,18,6,"But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, that we may inquire of him?"
14,18,7,"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah: but I hate him; for he never prophesieth good concerning me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so."
14,18,8,"Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla."
14,18,9,"Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them."
14,18,10,"And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until they be consumed."
14,18,11,"And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper; for Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king."
14,18,12,"And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets `declare' good to the king with one mouth: let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good."
14,18,13,"And Micaiah said, As Jehovah liveth, what my God saith, that will I speak."
14,18,14,"And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper; and they shall be delivered into your hand."
14,18,15,"And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah?"
14,18,16,"And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and Jehovah said, These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace."
14,18,17,"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?"
14,18,18,"And `Micaiah' said, Therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left."
14,18,19,"And Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner."
14,18,20,"And there came forth a spirit, and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him. And Jehovah said unto him, Wherewith?"
14,18,21,"And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt entice him, and shalt prevail also: go forth, and do so."
14,18,22,"Now therefore, behold, Jehovah hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets; and Jehovah hath spoken evil concerning thee."
14,18,23,"Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of Jehovah from me to speak unto thee?"
14,18,24,"And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself."
14,18,25,"And the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;"
14,18,26,"and say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace."
14,18,27,"And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, Jehovah hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, ye peoples, all of you."
14,18,28,"So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead."
14,18,29,"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went into the battle."
14,18,30,"Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel."
14,18,31,"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they turned about to fight against him: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and Jehovah helped him; and God moved them `to depart' from him."
14,18,32,"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him."
14,18,33,"And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor: wherefore he said to the driver of the chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded."
14,18,34,"And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even; and about the time of the going down of the sun he died."
14,19,1,"And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem."
14,19,2,"And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the wicked, and love them that hate Jehovah? for this thing wrath is upon thee from before Jehovah."
14,19,3,"Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast put away the Asheroth out of the land, and hast set thy heart to seek God."
14,19,4,"And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again among the people from Beer-sheba to the hill-country of Ephraim, and brought them back unto Jehovah, the God of their fathers."
14,19,5,"And he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,"
14,19,6,"and said to the judges, Consider what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for Jehovah; and `he is' with you in the judgment."
14,19,7,"Now therefore let the fear of Jehovah be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with Jehovah our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of bribes."
14,19,8,"Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites and the priests, and of the heads of the fathers' `houses' of Israel, for the judgment of Jehovah, and for controversies. And they returned to Jerusalem."
14,19,9,"And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of Jehovah, faithfully, and with a perfect heart."
14,19,10,"And whensoever any controversy shall come to you from your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, ye shall warn them, that they be not guilty towards Jehovah, and so wrath come upon you and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not be guilty."
14,19,11,"And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of Jehovah; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all the king's matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously, and Jehovah be with the good."
14,20,1,"And it came to pass after this, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them some of the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle."
14,20,2,"Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea from Syria; and, behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar (the same is En-gedi)."
14,20,3,"And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek unto Jehovah; and he proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah."
14,20,4,"And Judah gathered themselves together, to seek `help' of Jehovah: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek Jehovah."
14,20,5,"And Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of Jehovah, before the new court;"
14,20,6,"and he said, O Jehovah, the God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and art not thou ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations? and in thy hand is power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee."
14,20,7,"Didst not thou, O our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and give it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?"
14,20,8,"And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying,"
14,20,9,"If evil come upon us, the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house, and before thee, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry unto thee in our affliction, and thou wilt hear and save."
14,20,10,"And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned aside from them, and destroyed them not;"
14,20,11,"behold, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit."
14,20,12,"O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but out eyes are upon thee."
14,20,13,"And all Judah stood before Jehovah, with their little ones, their wives, and their children."
14,20,14,"Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite, of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of Jehovah in the midst of the assembly;"
14,20,15,"and he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat: Thus saith Jehovah unto you, Fear not ye, neither be dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's."
14,20,16,"To-morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the ascent of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel."
14,20,17,"Ye shall not need to fight in this `battle': set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of Jehovah with you, O Judah and Jerusalem; fear not, nor be dismayed: to-morrow go out against them: for Jehovah is with you."
14,20,18,"And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Jehovah, worshipping Jehovah."
14,20,19,"And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites, stood up to praise Jehovah, the God of Israel, with an exceeding loud voice."
14,20,20,"And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem: believe in Jehovah your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper."
14,20,21,"And when he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed them that should sing unto Jehovah, and give praise in holy array, as they went out before the army, and say, Give thanks unto Jehovah; for his lovingkindness `endureth' for ever."
14,20,22,"And when they began to sing and to praise, Jehovah set liers-in-wait against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, that were come against Judah; and they were smitten."
14,20,23,"For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another."
14,20,24,"And when Judah came to the watch-tower of the wilderness, they looked upon the multitude; and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there were none that escaped."
14,20,25,"And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches and dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in taking the spoil, it was so much."
14,20,26,"And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Beracah; for there they blessed Jehovah: therefore the name of that place was called The valley of Beracah unto this day."
14,20,27,"Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for Jehovah had made them to rejoice over their enemies."
14,20,28,"And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of Jehovah."
14,20,29,"And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the countries, when they heard that Jehovah fought against the enemies of Israel."
14,20,30,"So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet; for his God gave him rest round about."
14,20,31,"And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi."
14,20,32,"And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah."
14,20,33,"Howbeit the high places were not taken away; neither as yet had the people set their hearts unto the God of their fathers."
14,20,34,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is inserted in the book of the kings of Israel."
14,20,35,"And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel; the same did very wickedly:"
14,20,36,"and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish; and they made the ships in Ezion-geber."
14,20,37,"Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, Jehovah hath destroyed thy works. And the ships were broken, so that they were not able to go to Tarshish."
14,21,1,"And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead."
14,21,2,"And he had brethren, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel."
14,21,3,"And their father gave them great gifts, of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram, because he was the first-born."
14,21,4,"Now when Jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of his father, and had strengthened himself, he slew all his brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel."
14,21,5,"Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem."
14,21,6,"And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab; for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah."
14,21,7,"Howbeit Jehovah would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a lamp to him and to his children alway."
14,21,8,"In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves."
14,21,9,"Then Jehoram passed over with his captains, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites that compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots."
14,21,10,"So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day: then did Libnah revolt at the same time from under his hand, because he had forsaken Jehovah, the God of his fathers."
14,21,11,"Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot, and led Judah astray."
14,21,12,"And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,"
14,21,13,"but hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot, like as the house of Ahab did, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, who were better than thyself:"
14,21,14,"behold, Jehovah will smite with a great plague thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy substance;"
14,21,15,"and thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness, day by day."
14,21,16,"And Jehovah stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians that are beside the Ethiopians:"
14,21,17,"and they came up against Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons."
14,21,18,"And after all this Jehovah smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease."
14,21,19,"And it came to pass, in process of time, at the end of two years, that his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness, and he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers."
14,21,20,"Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years: and he departed without being desired; and they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings."
14,22,1,"And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead; for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned."
14,22,2,"Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri."
14,22,3,"He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab; for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly."
14,22,4,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did the house of Ahab; for they were his counsellors after the death of his father, to his destruction."
14,22,5,"He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians wounded Joram."
14,22,6,"And he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick."
14,22,7,"Now the destruction of Ahaziah was of God, in that he went unto Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Jehovah had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab."
14,22,8,"And it came to pass, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, that he found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, ministering to Ahaziah, and slew them."
14,22,9,"And he sought Ahaziah, and they caught him (now he was hiding in Samaria), and they brought him to Jehu, and slew him; and they buried him, for they said, He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Jehovah with all his heart. And the house of Ahaziah had no power to hold the kingdom."
14,22,10,"Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah."
14,22,11,"But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not."
14,22,12,"And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land."
14,23,1,"And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him."
14,23,2,"And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of fathers' `houses' of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem."
14,23,3,"And all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as Jehovah hath spoken concerning the sons of David."
14,23,4,"This is the thing that ye shall do: a third part of you, that come in on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the thresholds;"
14,23,5,"and a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of Jehovah."
14,23,6,"But let none come into the house of Jehovah, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall come in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the charge of Jehovah."
14,23,7,"And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever cometh into the house, let him be slain: and be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out."
14,23,8,"So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men, those that were to come in on the sabbath; with those that were to go out on the sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses."
14,23,9,"And Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David's, which were in the house of God."
14,23,10,"And he set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the king round about."
14,23,11,"Then they brought out the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and `gave him' the testimony, and made him king: and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him; and they said, `Long' live the king."
14,23,12,"And when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of Jehovah:"
14,23,13,"and she looked, and, behold, the king stood by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets; the singers also `played' on instruments of music, and led the singing of praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason! treason!"
14,23,14,"And Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth between the ranks; and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword: for the priest said, Slay her not in the house of Jehovah."
14,23,15,"So they made way for her; and she went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king's house: and they slew her there."
14,23,16,"And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, and all the people, and the king, that they should be Jehovah's people."
14,23,17,"And all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars."
14,23,18,"And Jehoiada appointed the officers of the house of Jehovah under the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of Jehovah, to offer the burnt-offerings of Jehovah, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, according to the order of David."
14,23,19,"And he set the porters at the gates of the house of Jehovah, that none that was unclean in anything should enter in."
14,23,20,"And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of Jehovah: and they came through the upper gate unto the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom."
14,23,21,"So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. And Athaliah they had slain with the sword."
14,24,1,"Joash was seven years old when he began to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Zibiah, of Beer-sheba."
14,24,2,"And Joash did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah all the days of Jehoiada the priest."
14,24,3,"And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters."
14,24,4,"And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to restore the house of Jehovah."
14,24,5,"And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year; and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not."
14,24,6,"And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tax of Moses the servant of Jehovah, and of the assembly of Israel, for the tent of the testimony?"
14,24,7,"For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of Jehovah did they bestow upon the Baalim."
14,24,8,"So the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of Jehovah."
14,24,9,"And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in for Jehovah the tax that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness."
14,24,10,"And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end."
14,24,11,"And it was so, that, at what time the chest was brought unto the king's officers by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the chief priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance."
14,24,12,"And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of Jehovah; and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of Jehovah, and also such as wrought iron and brass to repair the house of Jehovah."
14,24,13,"So the workmen wrought, and the work of repairing went forward in their hands, and they set up the house of God in its state, and strengthened it."
14,24,14,"And when they had made an end, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of Jehovah, even vessels wherewith to minister and to offer, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt-offerings in the house of Jehovah continually all the days of Jehoiada."
14,24,15,"But Jehoiada waxed old and was full of days, and he died; a hundred and thirty years old was he when he died."
14,24,16,"And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward God and his house."
14,24,17,"Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them."
14,24,18,"And they forsook the house of Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness."
14,24,19,"Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto Jehovah; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear."
14,24,20,"And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of Jehovah, so that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken Jehovah, he hath also forsaken you."
14,24,21,"And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of Jehovah."
14,24,22,"Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, Jehovah look upon it, and require it."
14,24,23,"And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the army of the Syrians came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus."
14,24,24,"For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men; and Jehovah delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken Jehovah, the God of their fathers. So they executed judgment upon Joash."
14,24,25,"And when they were departed for him (for they left him very sick), his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died; and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings."
14,24,26,"And these are they that conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess."
14,24,27,"Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens `laid' upon him, and the rebuilding of the house of God, behold, they are written in the commentary of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead."
14,25,1,"Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jehoaddan, of Jerusalem."
14,25,2,"And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, but not with a perfect heart."
14,25,3,"Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established unto him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father."
14,25,4,"But he put not their children to death, but did according to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses, as Jehovah commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin."
14,25,5,"Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and ordered them according to their fathers' houses, under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, even all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and upward, and found them three hundred thousand chosen men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield."
14,25,6,"He hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for a hundred talents of silver."
14,25,7,"But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for Jehovah is not with Israel, `to wit', with all the children of Ephraim."
14,25,8,"But if thou wilt go, do `valiantly', be strong for the battle: God will cast thee down before the enemy; for God hath power to help, and to cast down."
14,25,9,"And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, Jehovah is able to give thee much more than this."
14,25,10,"Then Amaziah separated them, `to wit', the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger."
14,25,11,"And Amaziah took courage, and led forth his people, and went to the Valley of Salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand."
14,25,12,"And `other' ten thousand did the children of Judah carry away alive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were broken in pieces."
14,25,13,"But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and smote of them three thousand, and took much spoil."
14,25,14,"Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them."
14,25,15,"Wherefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, who said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which have not delivered their own people out of thy hand?"
14,25,16,"And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that `the king' said unto him, Have we made thee of the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel."
14,25,17,"Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face."
14,25,18,"And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle."
14,25,19,"Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten Edom; and thy heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to `thy' hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?"
14,25,20,"But Amaziah would not hear; for it was of God, that he might deliver them into the hand `of their enemies', because they had sought after the gods of Edom."
14,25,21,"So Joash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah."
14,25,22,"And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent."
14,25,23,"And Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits."
14,25,24,"And `he took' all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria."
14,25,25,"And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years."
14,25,26,"Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?"
14,25,27,"Now from the time that Amaziah did turn away from following Jehovah they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there."
14,25,28,"And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah."
14,26,1,"And all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah."
14,26,2,"He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers."
14,26,3,"Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jechiliah, of Jerusalem."
14,26,4,"And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Amaziah had done."
14,26,5,"And he set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the vision of God: and as long as he sought Jehovah, God made him to prosper."
14,26,6,"And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities in `the country of' Ashdod, and among the Philistines."
14,26,7,"And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal, and the Meunim."
14,26,8,"And the Ammonites gave tribute to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt; for he waxed exceeding strong."
14,26,9,"Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning `of the wall', and fortified them."
14,26,10,"And he built towers in the wilderness, and hewed out many cisterns, for he had much cattle; in the lowland also, and in the plain: `and he had' husbandmen and vinedressers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields; for he loved husbandry."
14,26,11,"Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their reckoning made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains."
14,26,12,"The whole number of the heads of fathers' `houses', even the mighty men of valor, was two thousand and six hundred."
14,26,13,"And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy."
14,26,14,"And Uzziah prepared for them, even for all the host, shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, and stones for slinging."
14,26,15,"And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by skilful men, to be on the towers and upon the battlements, wherewith to shoot arrows and great stones. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong."
14,26,16,"But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up, so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against Jehovah his God; for he went into the temple of Jehovah to burn incense upon the altar of incense."
14,26,17,"And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of Jehovah, that were valiant men:"
14,26,18,"and they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It pertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto Jehovah, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honor from Jehovah God."
14,26,19,"Then Uzziah was wroth; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense; and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy brake forth in his forehead before the priests in the house of Jehovah, beside the altar of incense."
14,26,20,"And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out quickly from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because Jehovah had smitten him."
14,26,21,"And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of Jehovah: and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land."
14,26,22,"Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write."
14,26,23,"So Uzziah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead."
14,27,1,"Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok."
14,27,2,"And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Uzziah had done: howbeit he entered not into the temple of Jehovah. And the people did yet corruptly."
14,27,3,"He built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah, and on the wall of Ophel he built much."
14,27,4,"Moreover he built cities in the hill-country of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers."
14,27,5,"He fought also with the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon render unto him, in the second year also, and in the third."
14,27,6,"So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before Jehovah his God."
14,27,7,"Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah."
14,27,8,"He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem."
14,27,9,"And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead."
14,28,1,"Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he did not that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, like David his father;"
14,28,2,"but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for the Baalim."
14,28,3,"Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel."
14,28,4,"And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree."
14,28,5,"Wherefore Jehovah his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away of his a great multitude of captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter."
14,28,6,"For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day, all of them valiant men; because they had forsaken Jehovah, the God of their fathers."
14,28,7,"And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the ruler of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king."
14,28,8,"And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria."
14,28,9,"But a prophet of Jehovah was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out to meet the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because Jehovah, the God of your fathers, was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage which hath reached up to heaven."
14,28,10,"And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: `but' are there not even with you trespasses of your own against Jehovah your God?"
14,28,11,"Now hear me therefore, and send back the captives, that ye have taken captive of your brethren; for the fierce wrath of Jehovah is upon you."
14,28,12,"Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,"
14,28,13,"and said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for ye purpose that which will bring upon us a trespass against Jehovah, to add unto our sins and to our trespass; for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel."
14,28,14,"So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly."
14,28,15,"And the men that have been mentioned by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm-trees, unto their brethren: then they returned to Samaria."
14,28,16,"At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him."
14,28,17,"For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives."
14,28,18,"The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland, and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Soco with the towns thereof, and Timnah with the towns thereof, Gimzo also and the towns thereof: and they dwelt there."
14,28,19,"For Jehovah brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he had dealt wantonly in Judah, and trespassed sore against Jehovah."
14,28,20,"And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not."
14,28,21,"For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of Jehovah, and out of the house of the king and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of Assyria: but it helped him not."
14,28,22,"And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against Jehovah, this same king Ahaz."
14,28,23,"For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him; and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, `therefore' will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel."
14,28,24,"And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of Jehovah; and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem."
14,28,25,"And in every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger Jehovah, the God of his fathers."
14,28,26,"Now the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel."
14,28,27,"And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem; for they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead."
14,29,1,"Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old; and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah."
14,29,2,"And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that David his father had done."
14,29,3,"He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of Jehovah, and repaired them."
14,29,4,"And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the broad place on the east,"
14,29,5,"and said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites; now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of Jehovah, the God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place."
14,29,6,"For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Jehovah, and turned their backs."
14,29,7,"Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt-offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel."
14,29,8,"Wherefore the wrath of Jehovah was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to be tossed to and fro, to be an astonishment, and a hissing, as ye see with your eyes."
14,29,9,"For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this."
14,29,10,"Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Jehovah, the God of Israel, that his fierce anger may turn away from us."
14,29,11,"My sons, be not now negligent; for Jehovah hath chosen you to stand before him, to minister unto him, and that ye should be his ministers, and burn incense."
14,29,12,"Then the Levites arose, Mahath, the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah;"
14,29,13,"and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;"
14,29,14,"and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel."
14,29,15,"And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and went in, according to the commandment of the king by the words of Jehovah, to cleanse the house of Jehovah."
14,29,16,"And the priests went in unto the inner part of the house of Jehovah, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of Jehovah into the court of the house of Jehovah. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad to the brook Kidron."
14,29,17,"Now they began on the first `day' of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of Jehovah; and they sanctified the house of Jehovah in eight days: and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end."
14,29,18,"Then they went in to Hezekiah the king within `the palace', and said, We have cleansed all the house of Jehovah, and the altar of burnt-offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the table of showbread, with all the vessels thereof."
14,29,19,"Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away when he trespassed, have we prepared and sanctified; and, behold, they are before the altar of Jehovah."
14,29,20,"Then Hezekiah the king arose early, and gathered the princes of the city, and went up to the house of Jehovah."
14,29,21,"And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he-goats, for a sin-offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of Jehovah."
14,29,22,"So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: and they killed the rams, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar."
14,29,23,"And they brought near the he-goats for the sin-offering before the king and the assembly; and they laid their hands upon them:"
14,29,24,"and the priests killed them, and they made a sin-offering with their blood upon the altar, to make atonement for all Israel; for the king commanded `that' the burnt-offering and the sin-offering `should be made' for all Israel."
14,29,25,"And he set the Levites in the house of Jehovah with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet; for the commandment was of Jehovah by his prophets."
14,29,26,"And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets."
14,29,27,"And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt-offering upon the altar. And when the burnt-offering began, the song of Jehovah began also, and the trumpets, together with the instruments of David king of Israel."
14,29,28,"And all the assembly worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all this `continued' until the burnt-offering was finished."
14,29,29,"And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and worshipped."
14,29,30,"Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises unto Jehovah with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped."
14,29,31,"Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto Jehovah; come near and bring sacrifices and thank-offerings into the house of Jehovah. And the assembly brought in sacrifices and thank-offerings; and as many as were of a willing heart `brought' burnt-offerings."
14,29,32,"And the number of the burnt-offerings which the assembly brought was threescore and ten bullocks, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt-offering to Jehovah."
14,29,33,"And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep."
14,29,34,"But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt-offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests."
14,29,35,"And also the burnt-offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace-offerings, and with the drink-offerings for every burnt-offering. So the service of the house of Jehovah was set in order."
14,29,36,"And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, because of that which God had prepared for the people: for the thing was done suddenly."
14,30,1,"And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto Jehovah, the God of Israel."
14,30,2,"For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month."
14,30,3,"For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem."
14,30,4,"And the thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly."
14,30,5,"So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem: for they had not kept it in great numbers in such sort as it is written."
14,30,6,"So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may return to the remnant that are escaped of you out of the hand of the kings of Assyria."
14,30,7,"And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, who trespassed against Jehovah, the God of their fathers, so that he gave them up to desolation, as ye see."
14,30,8,"Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were; but yield yourselves unto Jehovah, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever, and serve Jehovah your God, that his fierce anger may turn away from you."
14,30,9,"For if ye turn again unto Jehovah, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that led them captive, and shall come again into this land: for Jehovah your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him."
14,30,10,"So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them."
14,30,11,"Nevertheless certain men of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem."
14,30,12,"Also upon Judah came the hand of God to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of Jehovah."
14,30,13,"And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly."
14,30,14,"And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron."
14,30,15,"Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth `day' of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt-offerings into the house of Jehovah."
14,30,16,"And they stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood `which they received' of the hand of the Levites."
14,30,17,"For there were many in the assembly that had not sanctified themselves: therefore the Levites had the charge of killing the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto Jehovah."
14,30,18,"For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, The good Jehovah pardon every one"
14,30,19,"that setteth his heart to seek God, Jehovah, the God of his fathers, though `he be' not `cleansed' according to the purification of the sanctuary."
14,30,20,"And Jehovah hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people."
14,30,21,"And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised Jehovah day by day, `singing' with loud instruments unto Jehovah."
14,30,22,"And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that had good understanding `in the service' of Jehovah. So they did eat throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace-offerings, and making confession to Jehovah, the God of their fathers."
14,30,23,"And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days; and they kept `other' seven days with gladness."
14,30,24,"For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the assembly for offerings a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves."
14,30,25,"And all the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly that came out of Israel, and the sojourners that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced."
14,30,26,"So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem."
14,30,27,"Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even unto heaven."
14,31,1,"Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake in pieces the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim, and brake down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities."
14,31,2,"And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt-offerings and for peace-offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of Jehovah."
14,31,3,"`He appointed' also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt-offerings, `to wit', for the morning and evening burnt-offerings, and the burnt-offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of Jehovah."
14,31,4,"Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the law of Jehovah."
14,31,5,"And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel gave in abundance the first-fruits of grain, new wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly."
14,31,6,"And the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated unto Jehovah their God, and laid them by heaps."
14,31,7,"In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month."
14,31,8,"And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed Jehovah, and his people Israel."
14,31,9,"Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps."
14,31,10,"And Azariah the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, answered him and said, Since `the people' began to bring the oblations into the house of Jehovah, we have eaten and had enough, and have left plenty: for Jehovah hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store."
14,31,11,"Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of Jehovah; and they prepared them."
14,31,12,"And they brought in the oblations and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: and over them Conaniah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was second."
14,31,13,"And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God."
14,31,14,"And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter at the east `gate', was over the freewill-offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of Jehovah, and the most holy things."
14,31,15,"And under him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their office of trust, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small:"
14,31,16,"besides them that were reckoned by genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even every one that entered into the house of Jehovah, as the duty of every day required, for their service in their offices according to their courses;"
14,31,17,"and them that were reckoned by genealogy of the priests by their fathers' houses, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their offices by their courses;"
14,31,18,"and them that were reckoned by genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their office of trust they sanctified themselves in holiness."
14,31,19,"Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, that were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every city, there were men that were mentioned by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogy among the Levites."
14,31,20,"And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah; and he wrought that which was good and right and faithful before Jehovah his God."
14,31,21,"And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered."
14,32,1,"After these things, and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to win them for himself."
14,32,2,"And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,"
14,32,3,"he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city; and they helped him."
14,32,4,"So there was gathered much people together, and they stopped all the fountains, and the brook that flowed through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?"
14,32,5,"And he took courage, and built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised `it' up to the towers, and the other wall without, and strengthened Millo `in' the city of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance."
14,32,6,"And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,"
14,32,7,"Be strong and of good courage, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him; for there is a greater with us than with him:"
14,32,8,"with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is Jehovah our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah."
14,32,9,"After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (now he was before Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,"
14,32,10,"Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide the siege in Jerusalem?"
14,32,11,"Doth not Hezekiah persuade you, to give you over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, Jehovah our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?"
14,32,12,"Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and upon it shall ye burn incense?"
14,32,13,"Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands in any wise able to deliver their land out of my hand?"
14,32,14,"Who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?"
14,32,15,"Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you after this manner, neither believe ye him; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?"
14,32,16,"And his servants spake yet more against Jehovah God, and against his servant Hezekiah."
14,32,17,"He wrote also letters, to rail on Jehovah, the God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of the lands, which have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of my hand."
14,32,18,"And they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city."
14,32,19,"And they spake of the God of Jerusalem, as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men's hands."
14,32,20,"And Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven."
14,32,21,"And Jehovah sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains, in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth from his own bowels slew him there with the sword."
14,32,22,"Thus Jehovah saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all `others', and guided them on every side."
14,32,23,"And many brought gifts unto Jehovah to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah; so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from thenceforth."
14,32,24,"In those days Hezekiah was sick even unto death: and he prayed unto Jehovah; and he spake unto him, and gave him a sign."
14,32,25,"But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem."
14,32,26,"Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of Jehovah came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah."
14,32,27,"And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor: and he provided him treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of goodly vessels;"
14,32,28,"store-houses also for the increase of grain and new wine and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and flocks in folds."
14,32,29,"Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very much substance."
14,32,30,"This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works."
14,32,31,"Howbeit in `the business of' the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart."
14,32,32,"Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel."
14,32,33,"And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead."
14,33,1,"Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem."
14,33,2,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, after the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel."
14,33,3,"For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars for the Baalim, and made Asheroth, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them."
14,33,4,"And he built altars in the house of Jehovah, whereof Jehovah said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever."
14,33,5,"And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of Jehovah."
14,33,6,"He also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom; and he practised augury, and used enchantments, and practised sorcery, and dealt with them that had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger."
14,33,7,"And he set the graven image of the idol, which he had made, in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:"
14,33,8,"neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, even all the law and the statutes and the ordinances `given' by Moses."
14,33,9,"And Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did evil more than did the nations whom Jehovah destroyed before the children of Israel."
14,33,10,"And Jehovah spake to Manasseh, and to his people; but they gave no heed."
14,33,11,"Wherefore Jehovah brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh in chains, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon."
14,33,12,"And when he was in distress, he besought Jehovah his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers."
14,33,13,"And he prayed unto him; and he was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that Jehovah he was God."
14,33,14,"Now after this he built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate; and he compassed Ophel about `with it', and raised it up to a very great height: and he put valiant captains in all the fortified cities of Judah."
14,33,15,"And he took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of the house of Jehovah, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of Jehovah, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city."
14,33,16,"And he built up the altar of Jehovah, and offered thereon sacrifices of peace-offerings and of thanksgiving, and commanded Judah to serve Jehovah, the God of Israel."
14,33,17,"Nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places, but only unto Jehovah their God."
14,33,18,"Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel, behold, they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel."
14,33,19,"His prayer also, and how `God' was entreated of him, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up the Asherim and the graven images, before he humbled himself: behold, they are written in the history of Hozai."
14,33,20,"So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead."
14,33,21,"Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem."
14,33,22,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed unto all the graven images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them."
14,33,23,"And he humbled not himself before Jehovah, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but this same Amon trespassed more and more."
14,33,24,"And his servants conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house."
14,33,25,"But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead."
14,34,1,"Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem."
14,34,2,"And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in the ways of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left."
14,34,3,"For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images."
14,34,4,"And they brake down the altars of the Baalim in his presence; and the sun-images that were on high above them he hewed down; and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strewed it upon the graves `of them' that had sacrificed unto them."
14,34,5,"And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem."
14,34,6,"And `so did he' in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, in their ruins round about."
14,34,7,"And he brake down the altars, and beat the Asherim and the graven images into powder, and hewed down all the sun-images throughout all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem."
14,34,8,"Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of Jehovah his God."
14,34,9,"And they came to Hilkiah the high priest, and delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
14,34,10,"And they delivered it into the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of Jehovah; and the workmen that wrought in the house of Jehovah gave it to mend and repair the house;"
14,34,11,"even to the carpenters and to the builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed."
14,34,12,"And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and `others of' the Levites, all that were skilful with instruments of music."
14,34,13,"Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and set forward all that did the work in every manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters."
14,34,14,"And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of Jehovah `given' by Moses."
14,34,15,"And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan."
14,34,16,"And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they are doing."
14,34,17,"And they have emptied out the money that was found in the house of Jehovah, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen."
14,34,18,"And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read therein before the king."
14,34,19,"And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes."
14,34,20,"And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying,"
14,34,21,"Go ye, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of Jehovah, to do according unto all that is written in this book."
14,34,22,"So Hilkiah, and they whom the king `had commanded', went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter;) and they spake to her to that effect."
14,34,23,"And she said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Tell ye the man that sent you unto me,"
14,34,24,"Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah."
14,34,25,"Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore is my wrath poured out upon this place, and it shall not be quenched."
14,34,26,"But unto the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: As touching the words which thou hast heard,"
14,34,27,"because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and hast humbled thyself before me, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith Jehovah."
14,34,28,"Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof. And they brought back word to the king."
14,34,29,"Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem."
14,34,30,"And the king went up to the house of Jehovah, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, both great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of Jehovah."
14,34,31,"And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book."
14,34,32,"And he caused all that were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand `to it'. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers."
14,34,33,"And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were found in Israel to serve, even to serve Jehovah their God. All his days they departed not from following Jehovah, the God of their fathers."
14,35,1,"And Josiah kept a passover unto Jehovah in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth `day' of the first month."
14,35,2,"And he set the priests in their offices, and encouraged them to the service of the house of Jehovah."
14,35,3,"And he said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, that were holy unto Jehovah, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; there shall no more be a burden upon your shoulders: now serve Jehovah your God, and his people Israel."
14,35,4,"And prepare yourselves after your fathers' houses by your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son."
14,35,5,"And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers' houses of your brethren the children of the people, and `let there be for each' a portion of a fathers' house of the Levites."
14,35,6,"And kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brethren, to do according to the word of Jehovah by Moses."
14,35,7,"And Josiah gave to the children of the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all of them for the passover-offerings, unto all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king's substance."
14,35,8,"And his princes gave for a freewill-offering unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover-offerings two thousand and six hundred `small cattle', and three hundred oxen."
14,35,9,"Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for the passover-offerings five thousand `small cattle', and five hundred oxen."
14,35,10,"So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their courses, according to the king's commandment."
14,35,11,"And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled `the blood which they received' of their hand, and the Levites flayed them."
14,35,12,"And they removed the burnt-offerings, that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers' houses of the children of the people, to offer unto Jehovah, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen."
14,35,13,"And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: and the holy offerings boiled they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children of the people."
14,35,14,"And afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron `were busied' in offering the burnt-offerings and the fat until night: therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron."
14,35,15,"And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters were at every gate: they needed not to depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them."
14,35,16,"So all the service of Jehovah was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt-offerings upon the altar of Jehovah, according to the commandment of king Josiah."
14,35,17,"And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days."
14,35,18,"And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did any of the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
14,35,19,"In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept."
14,35,20,"After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him."
14,35,21,"But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? `I come' not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war; and God hath commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from `meddling with' God, who is with me, that he destroy thee not."
14,35,22,"Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo."
14,35,23,"And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded."
14,35,24,"So his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah."
14,35,25,"And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations unto this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations."
14,35,26,"Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds, according to that which is written in the law of Jehovah,"
14,35,27,"and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah."
14,36,1,"Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem."
14,36,2,"Joahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem."
14,36,3,"And the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and fined the land a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold."
14,36,4,"And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt."
14,36,5,"Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah his God."
14,36,6,"Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon."
14,36,7,"Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of Jehovah to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon."
14,36,8,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead."
14,36,9,"Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah."
14,36,10,"And at the return of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of Jehovah, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem."
14,36,11,"Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem:"
14,36,12,"and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah his God; he humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet `speaking' from the mouth of Jehovah."
14,36,13,"And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart against turning unto Jehovah, the God of Israel."
14,36,14,"Moreover all the chiefs of the priests, and the people, trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations; and they polluted the house of Jehovah which he had hallowed in Jerusalem."
14,36,15,"And Jehovah, the God of their fathers, sent to them by his messengers, rising up early and sending, because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling-place:"
14,36,16,"but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until the wrath of Jehovah arose against his people, till there was no remedy."
14,36,17,"Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldeans, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or virgin, old man or hoary-headed: he gave them all into his hand."
14,36,18,"And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes, all these he brought to Babylon."
14,36,19,"And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof."
14,36,20,"And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:"
14,36,21,"to fulfil the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths: `for' as long as it lay desolate it kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years."
14,36,22,"Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and `put it' also in writing, saying,"
14,36,23,"Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath Jehovah, the God of heaven, given me; and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whosoever there is among you of all his people, Jehovah his God be with him, and let him go up."
15,1,1,"Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and `put it' also in writing, saying,"
15,1,2,"Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath Jehovah, the God of heaven, given me; and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah."
15,1,3,"Whosoever there is among you of all his people, his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of Jehovah, the God of Israel (he is God), which is in Jerusalem."
15,1,4,"And whosoever is left, in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, besides the freewill-offering for the house of God which is in Jerusalem."
15,1,5,"Then rose up the heads of fathers' `houses' of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, even all whose spirit God had stirred to go up to build the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem."
15,1,6,"And all they that were round about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered."
15,1,7,"Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of Jehovah, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put in the house of his gods;"
15,1,8,"even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah."
15,1,9,"And this is the number of them: thirty platters of gold, a thousand platters of silver, nine and twenty knives,"
15,1,10,"thirty bowls of gold, silver bowls of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand."
15,1,11,"All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up, when they of the captivity were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem."
15,2,1,"Now these are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon, and that returned unto Jerusalem and Judah, every one unto his city;"
15,2,2,"who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:"
15,2,3,"The children of Parosh, two thousand a hundred seventy and two."
15,2,4,"The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy and two."
15,2,5,"The children of Arah, seven hundred seventy and five."

15,2,43,"The Nethinim: the children of Ziha, the children of Hasupha, the children of Tabbaoth,"
15,2,44,"the children of Keros, the children of Siaha, the children of Padon,"
15,2,45,"the children of Lebanah, the children of Hagabah, the children of Akkub,"
15,2,46,"the children of Hagab, the children of Shamlai, the children of Hanan,"
15,2,47,"the children of Giddel, the children of Gahar, the children of Reaiah,"
15,2,48,"the children of Rezin, the children of Nekoda, the children of Gazzam,"
15,2,49,"the children of Uzza, the children of Paseah, the children of Besai,"

15,2,57,"the children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth-hazzebaim, the children of Ami."
15,2,58,"All the Nethinim, and the children of Solomon's servants, were three hundred ninety and two."
15,2,59,"And these were they that went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addan, `and' Immer; but they could not show their fathers' houses, and their seed, whether they were of Israel:"
15,2,60,"the children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two."
15,2,61,"And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name."
15,2,62,"These sought their register `among' those that were reckoned by genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood."
15,2,63,"And the governor said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim."
15,2,64,"The whole assembly together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore,"
15,2,65,"besides their men-servants and their maid-servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred singing men and singing women."
15,2,66,"Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five;"
15,2,67,"their camels, four hundred thirty and five; `their' asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty."
15,2,68,"And some of the heads of fathers' `houses', when they came to the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem, offered willingly for the house of God to set it up in its place:"
15,2,69,"they gave after their ability into the treasury of the work threescore and one thousand darics of gold, and five thousand pounds of silver, and one hundred priests' garments."
15,2,70,"So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinim, dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities."
15,3,1,"And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem."
15,3,2,"Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt-offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God."
15,3,3,"And they set the altar upon its base; for fear was upon them because of the peoples of the countries: and they offered burnt-offerings thereon unto Jehovah, even burnt-offerings morning and evening."
15,3,4,"And they kept the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and `offered' the daily burnt-offerings by number, according to the ordinance, as the duty of every day required;"
15,3,5,"and afterward the continual burnt-offering, and `the offerings' of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of Jehovah that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill-offering unto Jehovah."
15,3,6,"From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah: but the foundation of the temple of Jehovah was not yet laid."
15,3,7,"They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and food, and drink, and oil, unto them of Sidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar-trees from Lebanon to the sea, unto Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia."
15,3,8,"Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem, and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to have the oversight of the work of the house of Jehovah."
15,3,9,"Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to have the oversight of the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites."
15,3,10,"And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise Jehovah, after the order of David king of Israel."
15,3,11,"And they sang one to another in praising and giving thanks unto Jehovah, `saying', For he is good, for his lovingkindness `endureth' for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised Jehovah, because the foundation of the house of Jehovah was laid."
15,3,12,"But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers' `houses', the old men that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:"
15,3,13,"so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people; for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off."
15,4,1,"Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple unto Jehovah, the God of Israel;"
15,4,2,"then they drew near to Zerubbabel, and to the heads of fathers' `houses', and said unto them, Let us build with you; for we seek your God, as ye do; and we sacrifice unto him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assyria, who brought us up hither."
15,4,3,"But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers' `houses' of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us in building a house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us."
15,4,4,"Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,"
15,4,5,"and hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia."
15,4,6,"And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem."
15,4,7,"And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian `character', and set forth in the Syrian `tongue'."
15,4,8,"Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:"
15,4,9,"then `wrote' Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions, the Dinaites, and the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the Dehaites, the Elamites,"
15,4,10,"and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over, and set in the city of Samaria, and in the rest `of the country' beyond the River, and so forth."
15,4,11,"This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto Artaxerxes the king: Thy servants the men beyond the River, and so forth."
15,4,12,"Be it known unto the king, that the Jews that came up from thee are come to us unto Jerusalem; they are building the rebellious and the bad city, and have finished the walls, and repaired the foundations."
15,4,13,"Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and in the end it will be hurtful unto the kings."
15,4,14,"Now because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not meet for us to see the king's dishonor, therefore have we sent and certified the king;"
15,4,15,"that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time; for which cause was this city laid waste."
15,4,16,"We certify the king that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, by this means thou shalt have no portion beyond the River."
15,4,17,"`Then' sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and in the rest `of the country' beyond the River: Peace, and so forth."
15,4,18,"The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me."
15,4,19,"And I decreed, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein."
15,4,20,"There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all `the country' beyond the River; and tribute, custom, and toll, was paid unto them."
15,4,21,"Make ye now a decree to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until a decree shall be made by me."
15,4,22,"And take heed that ye be not slack herein: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?"
15,4,23,"Then when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power."
15,4,24,"Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia."
15,5,1,"Now the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem; in the name of the God of Israel `prophesied they' unto them."
15,5,2,"Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, helping them."
15,5,3,"At the same time came to them Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?"
15,5,4,"Then we told them after this manner, what the names of the men were that were making this building."
15,5,5,"But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, and they did not make them cease, till the matter should come to Darius, and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it."
15,5,6,"The copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and his companions the Apharsachites, who were beyond the River, sent unto Darius the king;"
15,5,7,"they sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus: Unto Darius the king, all peace."
15,5,8,"Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls; and this work goeth on with diligence and prospereth in their hands."
15,5,9,"Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?"
15,5,10,"We asked them their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were at the head of them."
15,5,11,"And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and are building the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and finished."
15,5,12,"But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon."
15,5,13,"But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God."
15,5,14,"And the gold and silver vessels also of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;"
15,5,15,"and he said unto him, Take these vessels, go, put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in its place."
15,5,16,"Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundations of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not completed."
15,5,17,"Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure-house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem; and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter."
15,6,1,"Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the archives, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon."
15,6,2,"And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of Media, a roll, and therein was thus written for a record:"
15,6,3,"In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king made a decree: Concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, let the house be builded, the place where they offer sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits;"
15,6,4,"with three courses of great stones, and a course of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king's house."
15,6,5,"And also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to its place; and thou shalt put them in the house of God."
15,6,6,"Now therefore, Tattenai, governor beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and your companions the Apharsachites, who are beyond the River, be ye far from thence:"
15,6,7,"let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place."
15,6,8,"Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to these elders of the Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the River, expenses be given with all diligence unto these men, that they be not hindered."
15,6,9,"And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for burnt-offerings to the God of heaven; `also' wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the word of the priests that are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail;"
15,6,10,"that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savor unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons."
15,6,11,"Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let a beam be pulled out from his house, and let him be lifted up and fastened thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this:"
15,6,12,"and the God that hath caused his name to dwell there overthrow all kings and peoples that shall put forth their hand to alter `the same', to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with all diligence."
15,6,13,"Then Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, because that Darius the king had sent, did accordingly with all diligence."
15,6,14,"And the elders of the Jews builded and prospered, through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia."
15,6,15,"And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king."
15,6,16,"And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy."
15,6,17,"And they offered at the dedication of this house of God a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin-offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel."
15,6,18,"And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses."
15,6,19,"And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth `day' of the first month."
15,6,20,"For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were pure: and they killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves."
15,6,21,"And the children of Israel that were come again out of the captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the nations of the land, to seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, did eat,"
15,6,22,"and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for Jehovah had made them joyful, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel."
15,7,1,"Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,"
15,7,2,"the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,"
15,7,3,"the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,"
15,7,4,"the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,"
15,7,5,"the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest;"
15,7,6,"this Ezra went up from Babylon: and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which Jehovah, the God of Israel, had given; and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of Jehovah his God upon him."
15,7,7,"And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinim, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king."
15,7,8,"And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king."
15,7,9,"For upon the first `day' of the first month began he to go up from Babylon; and on the first `day' of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him."
15,7,10,"For Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of Jehovah, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and ordinances."
15,7,11,"Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even the scribe of the words of the commandments of Jehovah, and of his statutes to Israel:"
15,7,12,"Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect and so forth."
15,7,13,"I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and their priests and the Levites, in my realm, that are minded of their own free will to go to Jerusalem, go with thee."
15,7,14,"Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king and his seven counsellors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thy hand,"
15,7,15,"and to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem,"
15,7,16,"and all the silver and gold that thou shalt find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill-offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem;"
15,7,17,"therefore thou shalt with all diligence buy with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meal-offerings and their drink-offerings, and shalt offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem."
15,7,18,"And whatsoever shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do ye after the will of your God."
15,7,19,"And the vessels that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem."
15,7,20,"And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure-house."
15,7,21,"And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers that are beyond the River, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done with all diligence,"
15,7,22,"unto a hundred talents of silver, and to a hundred measures of wheat, and to a hundred baths of wine, and to a hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much."
15,7,23,"Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?"
15,7,24,"Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, the singers, porters, Nethinim, or servants of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, custom, or toll, upon them."
15,7,25,"And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God that is in thy hand, appoint magistrates and judges, who may judge all the people that are beyond the River, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye him that knoweth them not."
15,7,26,"And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed upon him with all diligence, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment."
15,7,27,"Blessed be Jehovah, the God of our fathers, who hath put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem;"
15,7,28,"and hath extended lovingkindness unto me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened according to the hand of Jehovah my God upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me."
15,8,1,"Now these are the heads of their fathers' `houses', and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king:"
15,8,2,"Of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom. Of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel. Of the sons of David, Hattush."
15,8,3,"Of the sons of Shecaniah, of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah; and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males a hundred and fifty."
15,8,4,"Of the sons of Pahath-moab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah; and with him two hundred males."
15,8,5,"Of the sons of Shecaniah, the son of Jahaziel; and with him three hundred males."
15,8,6,"And of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan; and with him fifty males."
15,8,7,"And of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah; and with him seventy males."
15,8,8,"And of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael; and with him fourscore males."
15,8,9,"Of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel; and with him two hundred and eighteen males."
15,8,10,"And of the sons of Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah; and with him a hundred and threescore males."
15,8,11,"And of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai; and with him twenty and eight males."
15,8,12,"And of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan; and with him a hundred and ten males."
15,8,13,"And of the sons of Adonikam, `that were' the last; and these are their names: Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah; and with them threescore males."
15,8,14,"And of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud; and with them seventy males."
15,8,15,"And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; and there we encamped three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi."
15,8,16,"Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, who were teachers."
15,8,17,"And I sent them forth unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia; and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, `and' his brethren the Nethinim, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God."
15,8,18,"And according to the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;"
15,8,19,"and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty;"
15,8,20,"and of the Nethinim, whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim: all of them were mentioned by name."
15,8,21,"Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek of him a straight way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance."
15,8,22,"For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way, because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them that seek him, for good; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him."
15,8,23,"So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was entreated of us."
15,8,24,"Then I set apart twelve of the chiefs of the priests, even Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,"
15,8,25,"and weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering for the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his princes, and all Israel there present, had offered:"
15,8,26,"I weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels a hundred talents; of gold a hundred talents;"
15,8,27,"and twenty bowls of gold, of a thousand darics; and two vessels of fine bright brass, precious as gold."
15,8,28,"And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto Jehovah, and the vessels are holy; and the silver and the gold are a freewill-offering unto Jehovah, the God of your fathers."
15,8,29,"Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the princes of the fathers' `houses' of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of Jehovah."
15,8,30,"So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God."
15,8,31,"Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth `day' of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the lier-in-wait by the way."
15,8,32,"And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days."
15,8,33,"And on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, the Levite;"
15,8,34,"the whole by number and by weight: and all the weight was written at that time."
15,8,35,"The children of the captivity, that were come out of exile, offered burnt-offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he-goats for a sin-offering: all this was a burnt-offering unto Jehovah."
15,8,36,"And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's satraps, and to the governors beyond the River: and they furthered the people and the house of God."
15,9,1,"Now when these things were done, the princes drew near unto me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, `doing' according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites."
15,9,2,"For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the peoples of the lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass."
15,9,3,"And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my robe, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down confounded."
15,9,4,"Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the trespass of them of the captivity; and I sat confounded until the evening oblation."
15,9,5,"And at the evening oblation I arose up from my humiliation, even with my garment and my robe rent; and I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto Jehovah my God;"
15,9,6,"and I said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God; for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our guiltiness is grown up unto the heavens."
15,9,7,"Since the days of our fathers we have been exceeding guilty unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to plunder, and to confusion of face, as it is this day."
15,9,8,"And now for a little moment grace hath been showed from Jehovah our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage."
15,9,9,"For we are bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended lovingkindness unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the ruins thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem."
15,9,10,"And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,"
15,9,11,"which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, through their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their filthiness:"
15,9,12,"now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their prosperity for ever; that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever."
15,9,13,"And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great guilt, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such a remnant,"
15,9,14,"shall we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the peoples that do these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape?"
15,9,15,"O Jehovah, the God of Israel, thou art righteous; for we are left a remnant that is escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our guiltiness; for none can stand before thee because of this."
15,10,1,"Now while Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there was gathered together unto him out of Israel a very great assembly of men and women and children; for the people wept very sore."
15,10,2,"And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land: yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing."
15,10,3,"Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law."
15,10,4,"Arise; for the matter belongeth unto thee, and we are with thee: be of good courage, and do it."
15,10,5,"Then arose Ezra, and made the chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. So they sware."
15,10,6,"Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib: and `when' he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water; for he mourned because of the trespass of them of the captivity."
15,10,7,"And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;"
15,10,8,"and that whosoever came not within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the assembly of the captivity."
15,10,9,"Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within the three days; it was the ninth month, on the twentieth `day' of the month: and all the people sat in the broad place before the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain."
15,10,10,"And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have trespassed, and have married foreign women, to increase the guilt of Israel."
15,10,11,"Now therefore make confession unto Jehovah, the God of your fathers, and do his pleasure; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the foreign women."
15,10,12,"Then all the assembly answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said concerning us, so must we do."
15,10,13,"But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without: neither is this a work of one day or two; for we have greatly transgressed in this matter."
15,10,14,"Let now our princes be appointed for all the assembly, and let all them that are in our cities that have married foreign women come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God be turned from us, until this matter be despatched."
15,10,15,"Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this `matter': and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them."
15,10,16,"And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, `with' certain heads of fathers' `houses', after their fathers' houses, and all of them by their names, were set apart; and they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter."
15,10,17,"And they made an end with all the men that had married foreign women by the first day of the first month."
15,10,18,"And among the sons of the priests there were found that had married foreign women: `namely', of the sons of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and his brethren, Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah."
15,10,19,"And they gave their hand that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, `they offered' a ram of the flock for their guilt."

16,1,1,"The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,"
16,1,2,"that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, that were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem."
16,1,3,"And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire."
16,1,4,"And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,"
16,1,5,"and said, I beseech thee, O Jehovah, the God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments:"
16,1,6,"Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee. Yea, I and my father's house have sinned:"
16,1,7,"we have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses."
16,1,8,"Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye trespass, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples:"
16,1,9,"but if ye return unto me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there."
16,1,10,"Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand."
16,1,11,"O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who delight to fear thy name; and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. Now I was cupbearer to the king."
16,2,1,"And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, that I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been `beforetime' sad in his presence."
16,2,2,"And the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid."
16,2,3,"And I said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?"
16,2,4,"Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven."
16,2,5,"And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favor in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it."
16,2,6,"And the king said unto me (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time."
16,2,7,"Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River, that they may let me pass through till I come unto Judah;"
16,2,8,"and a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the castle which appertaineth to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me."
16,2,9,"Then I came to the governors beyond the River, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen."
16,2,10,"And when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly, for that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel."
16,2,11,"So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days."
16,2,12,"And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem; neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon."
16,2,13,"And I went out by night by the valley gate, even toward the jackal's well, and to the dung gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire."
16,2,14,"Then I went on to the fountain gate and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass."
16,2,15,"Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall; and I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and so returned."
16,2,16,"And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work."
16,2,17,"Then said I unto them, Ye see the evil case that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach."
16,2,18,"And I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me, as also of the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for the good `work'."
16,2,19,"But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?"
16,2,20,"Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem."
16,3,1,"Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Hammeah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananel."
16,3,2,"And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri."
16,3,3,"And the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof."
16,3,4,"And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabel. And next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Baana."
16,3,5,"And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their lord."
16,3,6,"And the old gate repaired Joiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof."
16,3,7,"And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, `that appertained' to the throne of the governor beyond the River."
16,3,8,"Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, goldsmiths. And next unto him repaired Hananiah one of the perfumers, and they fortified Jerusalem even unto the broad wall."
16,3,9,"And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of half the district of Jerusalem."
16,3,10,"And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, over against his house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabneiah."
16,3,11,"Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hasshub the son of Pahath-moab, repaired another portion, and the tower of the furnaces."
16,3,12,"And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Hallohesh, the ruler of half the district of Jerusalem, he and his daughters."
16,3,13,"The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits of the wall unto the dung gate."
16,3,14,"And the dung gate repaired Malchijah the son of Rechab, the ruler of the district of Beth-haccherem; he built it, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof."
16,3,15,"And the fountain gate repaired Shallun the son of Colhozeh, the ruler of the district of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Shelah by the king's garden, even unto the stairs that go down from the city of David."
16,3,16,"After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of half the district of Beth-zur, unto the place over against the sepulchres of David, and unto the pool that was made, and unto the house of the mighty men."
16,3,17,"After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next unto him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of half the district of Keilah, for his district."
16,3,18,"After him repaired their brethren, Bavvai the son of Henadad, the ruler of half the district of Keilah."
16,3,19,"And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another portion, over against the ascent to the armory at the turning `of the wall'."
16,3,20,"After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired another portion, from the turning `of the wall' unto the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest."
16,3,21,"After him repaired Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz another portion, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib."
16,3,22,"And after him repaired the priests, the men of the Plain."
16,3,23,"After them repaired Benjamin and Hasshub over against their house. After them repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah beside his own house."
16,3,24,"After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another portion, from the house of Azariah unto the turning `of the wall', and unto the corner."
16,3,25,"Palal the son of Uzai `repaired' over against the turning `of the wall', and the tower that standeth out from the upper house of the king, which is by the court of the guard. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh `repaired'."
16,3,26,"(Now the Nethinim dwelt in Ophel, unto the place over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that standeth out.)"
16,3,27,"After him the Tekoites repaired another portion, over against the great tower that standeth out, and unto the wall of Ophel."
16,3,28,"Above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over against his own house."
16,3,29,"After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his own house. And after him repaired Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah, the keeper of the east gate."
16,3,30,"After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, another portion. After him repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah over against his chamber."
16,3,31,"After him repaired Malchijah one of the goldsmiths unto the house of the Nethinim, and of the merchants, over against the gate of Hammiphkad, and to the ascent of the corner."
16,3,32,"And between the ascent of the corner and the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants."
16,4,1,"But it came to pass that, when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews."
16,4,2,"And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, seeing they are burned?"
16,4,3,"Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they are building, if a fox go up, he shall break down their stone wall."
16,4,4,"Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn back their reproach upon their own head, and give them up for a spoil in a land of captivity;"
16,4,5,"and cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee; for they have provoked `thee' to anger before the builders."
16,4,6,"So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto half `the height' thereof: for the people had a mind to work."
16,4,7,"But it came to pass that, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, `and' that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth;"
16,4,8,"and they conspired all of them together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion therein."
16,4,9,"But we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them."
16,4,10,"And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall."
16,4,11,"And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come into the midst of them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease."
16,4,12,"And it came to pass that, when the Jews that dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times from all places, Ye must return unto us."
16,4,13,"Therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places, I set `there' the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows."
16,4,14,"And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses."
16,4,15,"And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work."
16,4,16,"And it came to pass from that time forth, that half of my servants wrought in the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah."
16,4,17,"They all builded the wall and they that bare burdens laded themselves; every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other held his weapon;"
16,4,18,"and the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me."
16,4,19,"And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another:"
16,4,20,"in what place soever ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us; our God will fight for us."
16,4,21,"So we wrought in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared."
16,4,22,"Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day."
16,4,23,"So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard that followed me, none of us put off our clothes, every one `went with' his weapon `to' the water."
16,5,1,"Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews."
16,5,2,"For there were that said, We, our sons and our daughters, are many: let us get grain, that we may eat and live."
16,5,3,"Some also there were that said, We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses: let us get grain, because of the dearth."
16,5,4,"There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute `upon' our fields and our vineyards."
16,5,5,"Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondage `already': neither is it in our power to help it; for other men have our fields and our vineyards."
16,5,6,"And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words."
16,5,7,"Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I held a great assembly against them."
16,5,8,"And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, that were sold unto the nations; and would ye even sell your brethren, and should they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found never a word."
16,5,9,"Also I said, The thing that ye do is not good: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?"
16,5,10,"And I likewise, my brethren and my servants, do lend them money and grain. I pray you, let us leave off this usury."
16,5,11,"Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them."
16,5,12,"Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, even as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise."
16,5,13,"Also I shook out my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performeth not this promise; even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the assembly said, Amen, and praised Jehovah. And the people did according to this promise."
16,5,14,"Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, `that is', twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor."
16,5,15,"But the former governors that were before me were chargeable unto the people, and took of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God."
16,5,16,"Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work."
16,5,17,"Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, a hundred and fifty men, besides those that came unto us from among the nations that were round about us."
16,5,18,"Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this I demanded not the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people."
16,5,19,"Remember unto me, O my God, for good, all that I have done for this people."
16,6,1,"Now it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and unto the rest of our enemies, that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though even unto that time I had not set up the doors in the gates;)"
16,6,2,"that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in `one of' the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief."
16,6,3,"And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?"
16,6,4,"And they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner."
16,6,5,"Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,"
16,6,6,"wherein was written, It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause thou art building the wall: and thou wouldest be their king, according to these words."
16,6,7,"And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together."
16,6,8,"Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart."
16,6,9,"For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. But now, `O God', strengthen thou my hands."
16,6,10,"And I went unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee."
16,6,11,"And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in."
16,6,12,"And I discerned, and, lo, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him."
16,6,13,"For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me."
16,6,14,"Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear."
16,6,15,"So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth `day' of `the month' Elul, in fifty and two days."
16,6,16,"And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard `thereof', that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God."
16,6,17,"Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and `the letters' of Tobiah came unto them."
16,6,18,"For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife."
16,6,19,"Also they spake of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. `And' Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear."
16,7,1,"Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,"
16,7,2,"that I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the castle, charge over Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many."
16,7,3,"And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand `on guard', let them shut the doors, and bar ye them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one `to be' over against his house."
16,7,4,"Now the city was wide and large; but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded."
16,7,5,"And my God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of them that came up at the first, and I found written therein:"
16,7,6,"These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and that returned unto Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city;"
16,7,7,"who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:"
16,7,8,"The children of Parosh, two thousand a hundred and seventy and two."
16,7,9,"The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy and two."
16,7,10,"The children of Arah, six hundred fifty and two."
16,7,11,"The children of Pahath-moab, of the children of Jeshua and Joab, two thousand and eight hundred `and' eighteen."
16,7,12,"The children of Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and four."
16,7,13,"The children of Zattu, eight hundred forty and five."
16,7,14,"The children of Zaccai, seven hundred and threescore."
16,7,15,"The children of Binnui, six hundred forty and eight."
16,7,16,"The children of Bebai, six hundred twenty and eight."
16,7,17,"The children of Azgad, two thousand three hundred twenty and two."
16,7,18,"The children of Adonikam, six hundred threescore and seven."
16,7,19,"The children of Bigvai, two thousand threescore and seven."
16,7,20,"The children of Adin, six hundred fifty and five."
16,7,21,"The children of Ater, of Hezekiah, ninety and eight."
16,7,22,"The children of Hashum, three hundred twenty and eight."
16,7,23,"The children of Bezai, three hundred twenty and four."
16,7,24,"The children of Hariph, a hundred and twelve."
16,7,25,"The children of Gibeon, ninety and five."
16,7,26,"The men of Bethlehem and Netophah, a hundred fourscore and eight."
16,7,27,"The men of Anathoth, a hundred twenty and eight."
16,7,28,"The men of Beth-azmaveth, forty and two."
16,7,29,"The men of Kiriath-jearim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, seven hundred forty and three."
16,7,30,"The men of Ramah and Geba, six hundred twenty and one."
16,7,31,"The men of Michmas, a hundred and twenty and two."

16,7,61,"And these were they that went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer; but they could not show their fathers' houses, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel:"
16,7,62,"The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two."
16,7,63,"And of the priests: the children of Hobaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name."
16,7,64,"These sought their register `among' those that were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood."
16,7,65,"And the governor said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim."
16,7,66,"The whole assembly together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore,"
16,7,67,"besides their men-servants and their maid-servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women."

16,7,69,"`their' camels, four hundred thirty and five; `their' asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty."
16,7,70,"And some from among the heads of fathers' `houses' gave unto the work. The governor gave to the treasury a thousand darics of gold, fifty basins, five hundred and thirty priests' garments."
16,7,71,"And some of the heads of fathers' `houses' gave into the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pounds of silver."
16,7,72,"And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand pounds of silver, and threescore and seven priests' garments."
16,7,73,"So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinim, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities. And when the seventh month was come, the children of Israel were in their cities."
16,8,1,"And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the broad place that was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which Jehovah had commanded to Israel."
16,8,2,"And Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly, both men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month."
16,8,3,"And he read therein before the broad place that was before the water gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women, and of those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were `attentive' unto the book of the law."
16,8,4,"And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Uriah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchijah, and Hashum, and Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, `and' Meshullam."
16,8,5,"And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:"
16,8,6,"and Ezra blessed Jehovah, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with the lifting up of their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped Jehovah with their faces to the ground."
16,8,7,"Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people `stood' in their place."
16,8,8,"And they read in the book, in the law of God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, so that they understood the reading."
16,8,9,"And Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto Jehovah your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law."
16,8,10,"Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto him for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye grieved; for the joy of Jehovah is your strength."
16,8,11,"So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved."
16,8,12,"And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them."
16,8,13,"And on the second day were gathered together the heads of fathers' `houses' of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to give attention to the words of the law."
16,8,14,"And they found written in the law, how that Jehovah had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month;"
16,8,15,"and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and branches of wild olive, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written."
16,8,16,"So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the broad place of the water gate, and in the broad place of the gate of Ephraim."
16,8,17,"And all the assembly of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and dwelt in the booths; for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness."
16,8,18,"Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the ordinance."
16,9,1,"Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackcloth, and earth upon them."
16,9,2,"And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers."
16,9,3,"And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of Jehovah their God a fourth part of the day; and `another' fourth part they confessed, and worshipped Jehovah their God."
16,9,4,"Then stood up upon the stairs of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, `and' Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto Jehovah their God."
16,9,5,"Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, `and' Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless Jehovah your God from everlasting to everlasting; and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise."
16,9,6,"Thou art Jehovah, even thou alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all things that are thereon, the seas and all that is in them, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee."
16,9,7,"Thou art Jehovah the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham,"
16,9,8,"and foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, to give it unto his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous."
16,9,9,"And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red Sea,"
16,9,10,"and showedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land; for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them, and didst get thee a name, as it is this day."
16,9,11,"And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their pursuers thou didst cast into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters."
16,9,12,"Moreover in a pillar of cloud thou leddest them by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way wherein they should go."
16,9,13,"Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments,"
16,9,14,"and madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them commandments, and statutes, and a law, by Moses thy servant,"
16,9,15,"and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and commandedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them."
16,9,16,"But they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their neck, and hearkened not to thy commandments,"
16,9,17,"and refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them, but hardened their neck, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage. But thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and forsookest them not."
16,9,18,"Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;"
16,9,19,"yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud departed not from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way wherein they should go."
16,9,20,"Thou gavest also thy good Spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst."
16,9,21,"Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, `and' they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not."
16,9,22,"Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and peoples, which thou didst allot after their portions: so they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan."
16,9,23,"Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land concerning which thou didst say to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it."
16,9,24,"So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would."
16,9,25,"And they took fortified cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns hewn out, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit-trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness."
16,9,26,"Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their back, and slew thy prophets that testified against them to turn them again unto thee, and they wrought great provocations."
16,9,27,"Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours who saved them out of the hand of their adversaries."
16,9,28,"But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee; therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies,"
16,9,29,"and testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law. Yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thine ordinances, (which if a man do, he shall live in them,) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear."
16,9,30,"Yet many years didst thou bear with them, and testifiedst against them by thy Spirit through thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the peoples of the lands."
16,9,31,"Nevertheless in thy manifold mercies thou didst not make a full end of them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God."
16,9,32,"Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and lovingkindness, let not all the travail seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day."
16,9,33,"Howbeit thou art just in all that is come upon us; for thou hast dealt truly, but we have done wickedly;"
16,9,34,"neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies wherewith thou didst testify against them."
16,9,35,"For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works."
16,9,36,"Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it."
16,9,37,"And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have power over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress."
16,9,38,"And yet for all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, our Levites, `and' our priests, seal unto it."
16,10,1,"Now those that sealed were: Nehemiah the governor, the son of Hacaliah, and Zedekiah,"

16,10,28,"And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the porters, the singers, the Nethinim, and all they that had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands unto the law of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, every one that had knowledge, and understanding;"
16,10,29,"They clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in God's law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of Jehovah our Lord, and his ordinances and his statutes;"
16,10,30,"and that we would not give our daughters unto the peoples of the land, nor take their daughters for our sons;"
16,10,31,"and if the peoples of the land bring wares or any grain on the sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy of them on the sabbath, or on a holy day; and that we would forego the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt."
16,10,32,"Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God;"
16,10,33,"for the showbread, and for the continual meal-offering, and for the continual burnt-offering, for the sabbaths, for the new moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin-offerings to make atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God."
16,10,34,"And we cast lots, the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the wood-offering, to bring it into the house of our God, according to our fathers' houses, at times appointed, year by year, to burn upon the altar of Jehovah our God, as it is written in the law;"
16,10,35,"and to bring the first-fruits of our ground, and the first-fruits of all fruit of all manner of trees, year by year, unto the house of Jehovah;"
16,10,36,"also the first-born of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is written in the law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks, to bring to the house of our God, unto the priests that minister in the house of our God;"
16,10,37,"and that we should bring the first-fruits of our dough, and our heave-offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, the new wine and the oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the tithes of our ground unto the Levites; for they, the Levites, take the tithes in all the cities of our tillage."
16,10,38,"And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when the Levites take tithes: and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our God, to the chambers, into the treasure-house."
16,10,39,"For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the heave-offering of the grain, of the new wine, and of the oil, unto the chambers, where are the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests that minister, and the porters, and the singers: and we will not forsake the house of our God."
16,11,1,"And the princes of the people dwelt in Jerusalem: the rest of the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts in the `other' cities."
16,11,2,"And the people blessed all the men that willingly offered themselves to dwell in Jerusalem."
16,11,3,"Now these are the chiefs of the province that dwelt in Jerusalem: but in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his possession in their cities, `to wit', Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the Nethinim, and the children of Solomon's servants."
16,11,4,"And in Jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin. Of the children of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, of the children of Perez;"

16,11,19,"Moreover the porters, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren, that kept watch at the gates, were a hundred seventy and two."
16,11,20,"And the residue of Israel, of the priests, the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, every one in his inheritance."
16,11,21,"But the Nethinim dwelt in Ophel: and Ziha and Gishpa were over the Nethinim."
16,11,22,"The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica, of the sons of Asaph, the singers, over the business of the house of God."
16,11,23,"For there was a commandment from the king concerning them, and a settled provision for the singers, as every day required."
16,11,24,"And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the children of Zerah the son of Judah, was at the king's hand in all matters concerning the people."
16,11,25,"And as for the villages, with their fields, some of the children of Judah dwelt in Kiriath-arba and the towns thereof, and in Dibon and the towns thereof, and in Jekabzeel and the villages thereof,"
16,11,26,"and in Jeshua, and in Moladah, and Beth-pelet,"

16,11,30,"Zanoah, Adullam, and their villages, Lachish and the fields thereof, Azekah and the towns thereof. So they encamped from Beer-sheba unto the valley of Hinnom."
16,11,31,"The children of Benjamin also `dwelt' from Geba `onward', at Michmash and Aija, and at Beth-el and the towns thereof,"

16,12,19,"and of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;"
16,12,20,"of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;"
16,12,21,"of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel."
16,12,22,"As for the Levites, in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, there were recorded the heads of fathers' `houses'; also the priests, in the reign of Darius the Persian."
16,12,23,"The sons of Levi, heads of fathers' `houses', were written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib."
16,12,24,"And the chiefs of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise and give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, watch next to watch."
16,12,25,"Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters keeping the watch at the store-houses of the gates."
16,12,26,"These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest the scribe."
16,12,27,"And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps."
16,12,28,"And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites;"
16,12,29,"also from Beth-gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem."
16,12,30,"And the priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people, and the gates, and the wall."
16,12,31,"Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies that gave thanks and went in procession; `whereof one went' on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate:"
16,12,32,"and after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,"
16,12,33,"and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,"
16,12,34,"Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,"
16,12,35,"and certain of the priests' sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph;"
16,12,36,"and his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe was before them."
16,12,37,"And by the fountain gate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward."
16,12,38,"And the other company of them that gave thanks went to meet them, and I after them, with the half of the people, upon the wall, above the tower of the furnaces, even unto the broad wall,"
16,12,39,"and above the gate of Ephraim, and by the old gate, and by the fish gate, and the tower of Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the gate of the guard."
16,12,40,"So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me;"
16,12,41,"and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;"
16,12,42,"and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer."
16,12,43,"And they offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and the women also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off."
16,12,44,"And on that day were men appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the heave-offerings, for the first-fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited."
16,12,45,"And they kept the charge of their God, and the charge of the purification, and `so did' the singers and the porters, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son."
16,12,46,"For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God."
16,12,47,"And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, as every day required: and they set apart `that which was' for the Levites; and the Levites set apart `that which was' for the sons of Aaron."
16,13,1,"On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God for ever,"
16,13,2,"because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, to curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing."
16,13,3,"And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude."
16,13,4,"Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, being allied unto Tobiah,"
16,13,5,"had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meal-offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the heave-offerings for the priests."
16,13,6,"But in all this `time' I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went unto the king: and after certain days asked I leave of the king,"
16,13,7,"and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God."
16,13,8,"And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber."
16,13,9,"Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meal-offerings and the frankincense."
16,13,10,"And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them; so that the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field."
16,13,11,"Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place."
16,13,12,"Then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries."
16,13,13,"And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their business was to distribute unto their brethren."
16,13,14,"Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the observances thereof."
16,13,15,"In those days saw I in Judah some men treading wine-presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses `therewith'; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified `against them' in the day wherein they sold victuals."
16,13,16,"There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem."
16,13,17,"Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?"
16,13,18,"Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath."
16,13,19,"And it came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I over the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day."
16,13,20,"So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged without Jerusalem once or twice."
16,13,21,"Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath."
16,13,22,"And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember unto me, O my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy lovingkindness."
16,13,23,"In those days also saw I the Jews that had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, `and' of Moab:"
16,13,24,"and their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people."
16,13,25,"And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, `saying', Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves."
16,13,26,"Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin."
16,13,27,"Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?"
16,13,28,"And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me."
16,13,29,"Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites."
16,13,30,"Thus cleansed I them from all foreigners, and appointed charges for the priests and for the Levites, every one in his work;"
16,13,31,"and for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good."
17,1,1,"Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even unto Ethiopia, over a hundred and seven and twenty provinces),"
17,1,2,"that in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,"
17,1,3,"in the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him;"
17,1,4,"when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even a hundred and fourscore days."
17,1,5,"And when these days were fulfilled, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace."
17,1,6,"`There were hangings of' white `cloth', `of' green, and `of' blue, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the couches were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and white, and yellow, and black marble."
17,1,7,"And they gave them drink in vessels of gold (the vessels being diverse one from another), and royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king."
17,1,8,"And the drinking was according to the law; none could compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure."
17,1,9,"Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus."
17,1,10,"On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that ministered in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,"
17,1,11,"to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the peoples and the princes her beauty; for she was fair to look on."
17,1,12,"But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by the chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him."
17,1,13,"Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment;"
17,1,14,"and the next unto him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, and sat first in the kingdom),"
17,1,15,"What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not done the bidding of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?"
17,1,16,"And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the peoples that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus."
17,1,17,"For this deed of the queen will come abroad unto all women, to make their husbands contemptible in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not."
17,1,18,"And this day will the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the deed of the queen say `the like' unto all the king's princes. So `will there arise' much contempt and wrath."
17,1,19,"If it please the king, let there go forth a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, that Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she."
17,1,20,"And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give to their husbands honor, both to great and small."
17,1,21,"And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:"
17,1,22,"for he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and should speak according to the language of his people."
17,2,1,"After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her."
17,2,2,"Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:"
17,2,3,"and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hegai the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them;"
17,2,4,"and let the maiden that pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so."
17,2,5,"There was a certain Jew in Shushan the palace, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,"
17,2,6,"who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives that had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away."
17,2,7,"And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter."
17,2,8,"So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women."
17,2,9,"And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with her portions, and the seven maidens who were meet to be given her out of the king's house: and he removed her and her maidens to the best place of the house of the women."
17,2,10,"Esther had not made known her people nor her kindred; for Mordecai had charged her that she should not make it known."
17,2,11,"And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what would become of her."
17,2,12,"Now when the turn of every maiden was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that it had been done to her according to the law for the women twelve months (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, `to wit', six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors and with the things for the purifying of the women),"
17,2,13,"then in this wise came the maiden unto the king: whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house."
17,2,14,"In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, who kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and she were called by name."
17,2,15,"Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her."
17,2,16,"So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign."
17,2,17,"And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti."
17,2,18,"Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the bounty of the king."
17,2,19,"And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate."
17,2,20,"Esther had not yet made known her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him."
17,2,21,"In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those that kept the threshold, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus."
17,2,22,"And the thing became known to Mordecai, who showed it unto Esther the queen; and Esther told the king `thereof' in Mordecai's name."
17,2,23,"And when inquisition was made of the matter, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king."
17,3,1,"After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him."
17,3,2,"And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed down, and did reverence to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not down, nor did him reverence."
17,3,3,"Then the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?"
17,3,4,"Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew."
17,3,5,"And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not down, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath."
17,3,6,"But he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai."
17,3,7,"In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, `to' the twelfth `month', which is the month Adar."
17,3,8,"And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from `those of' every people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them."
17,3,9,"If it please the king, let it be written that they be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those that have the charge of the `king's' business, to bring it into the king's treasuries."
17,3,10,"And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy."
17,3,11,"And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee."
17,3,12,"Then were the king's scribes called in the first month, on the thirteenth day thereof; and there was written according to all that Haman commanded unto the king's satraps, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the princes of every people, to every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and it was sealed with the king's ring."
17,3,13,"And letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth `day' of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey."
17,3,14,"A copy of the writing, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published unto all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day."
17,3,15,"The posts went forth in haste by the king's commandment, and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed."
17,4,1,"Now when Mordecai knew all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;"
17,4,2,"and he came even before the king's gate: for none might enter within the king's gate clothed with sackcloth."
17,4,3,"And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes."
17,4,4,"And Esther's maidens and her chamberlains came and told it her; and the queen was exceedingly grieved: and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take his sackcloth from off him; but he received it not."
17,4,5,"Then called Esther for Hathach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and charged him to go to Mordecai, to know what this was, and why it was."
17,4,6,"So Hathach went forth to Mordecai unto the broad place of the city, which was before the king's gate."
17,4,7,"And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them."
17,4,8,"Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him, for her people."
17,4,9,"And Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai."
17,4,10,"Then Esther spake unto Hathach, and gave him a message unto Mordecai `saying':"
17,4,11,"All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days."
17,4,12,"And they told to Mordecai Esther's words."
17,4,13,"Then Mordecai bade them return answer unto Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews."
17,4,14,"For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then will relief and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place, but thou and thy father's house will perish: and who knoweth whether thou art not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"
17,4,15,"Then Esther bade them return answer unto Mordecai,"
17,4,16,"Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast in like manner; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish."
17,4,17,"So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him."
17,5,1,"Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the entrance of the house."
17,5,2,"And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favor in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre."
17,5,3,"Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be given thee even to the half of the kingdom."
17,5,4,"And Esther said, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him."
17,5,5,"Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that it may be done as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared."
17,5,6,"And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed."
17,5,7,"Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is:"
17,5,8,"if I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to-morrow as the king hath said."
17,5,9,"Then went Haman forth that day joyful and glad of heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up nor moved for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai."
17,5,10,"Nevertheless Haman refrained himself, and went home; and he sent and fetched his friends and Zeresh his wife."
17,5,11,"And Haman recounted unto them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king."
17,5,12,"Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to-morrow also am I invited by her together with the king."
17,5,13,"Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate."
17,5,14,"Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made."
17,6,1,"On that night could not the king sleep; and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles, and they were read before the king."
17,6,2,"And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, of those that kept the threshold, who had sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus."
17,6,3,"And the king said, What honor and dignity hath been bestowed on Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him."
17,6,4,"And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him."
17,6,5,"And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in."
17,6,6,"So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor? Now Haman said in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself?"
17,6,7,"And Haman said unto the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honor,"
17,6,8,"let royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and on the head of which a crown royal is set:"
17,6,9,"and let the apparel and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man therewith whom the king delighteth to honor, and cause him to ride on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor."
17,6,10,"Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken."
17,6,11,"Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and caused him to ride through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor."
17,6,12,"And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his house, mourning and having his head covered."
17,6,13,"And Haman recounted unto Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai, before whom thou hast begun to fall, be of the seed of the Jews, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him."
17,6,14,"While they were yet talking with him, came the king's chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared."
17,7,1,"So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen."
17,7,2,"And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed."
17,7,3,"Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favor in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:"
17,7,4,"for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the king's damage."
17,7,5,"Then spake the king Ahasuerus and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?"
17,7,6,"And Esther said, An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen."
17,7,7,"And the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine `and went' into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king."
17,7,8,"Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the couch whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he even force the queen before me in the house? As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face."
17,7,9,"Then said Harbonah, one of the chamberlains that were before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman hath made for Mordecai, who spake good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. And the king said, Hang him thereon."
17,7,10,"So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified."
17,8,1,"On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews' enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her."
17,8,2,"And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman."
17,8,3,"And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews."
17,8,4,"Then the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre. So Esther arose, and stood before the king."
17,8,5,"And she said, If it please the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews that are in all the king's provinces:"
17,8,6,"for how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?"
17,8,7,"Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews."
17,8,8,"Write ye also to the Jews, as it pleaseth you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring; for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse."
17,8,9,"Then were the king's scribes called at that time, in the third month Sivan, on the three and twentieth `day' thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the satraps, and the governors and princes of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, a hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language."
17,8,10,"And he wrote the name of king Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by post on horseback, riding on swift steeds that were used in the king's service, bred of the stud:"
17,8,11,"wherein the king granted the Jews that were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, `their' little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,"
17,8,12,"upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, `namely', upon the thirteenth `day' of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar."
17,8,13,"A copy of the writing, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published unto all the peoples, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies."
17,8,14,"So the posts that rode upon swift steeds that were used in the king's service went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment; and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace."
17,8,15,"And Mordecai went forth from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a robe of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan shouted and was glad."
17,8,16,"The Jews had light and gladness, and joy and honor."
17,8,17,"And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had gladness and joy, a feast and a good day. And many from among the peoples of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews was fallen upon them."
17,9,1,"Now in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have rule over them, (whereas it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them,)"
17,9,2,"the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them was fallen upon all the peoples."
17,9,3,"And all the princes of the provinces, and the satraps, and the governors, and they that did the king's business, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai was fallen upon them."
17,9,4,"For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went forth throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai waxed greater and greater."
17,9,5,"And the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they would unto them that hated them."
17,9,6,"And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men."
17,9,7,"And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,"
17,9,8,"and Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,"
17,9,9,"and Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vaizatha,"
17,9,10,"the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jew's enemy, slew they; but on the spoil they laid not their hand."
17,9,11,"On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king."
17,9,12,"And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces! Now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be done."
17,9,13,"Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews that are in Shushan to do to-morrow also according unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows."
17,9,14,"And the king commanded it so to be done: and a decree was given out in Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons."
17,9,15,"And the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men in Shushan; but on the spoil they laid not their hand."
17,9,16,"And the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of them that hated them seventy and five thousand; but on the spoil they laid not their hand."
17,9,17,"`This was done' on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness."
17,9,18,"But the Jews that were in Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth `day' thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth `day' of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness."
17,9,19,"Therefore do the Jews of the villages, that dwell in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar `a day of' gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another."
17,9,20,"And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far,"
17,9,21,"to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,"
17,9,22,"as the days wherein the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a good day; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor."
17,9,23,"And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;"
17,9,24,"because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;"
17,9,25,"but when `the matter' came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows."
17,9,26,"Wherefore they called these days Purim, after the name of Pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and that which had come unto them,"
17,9,27,"the Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so that it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to the writing thereof, and according to the appointed time thereof, every year;"
17,9,28,"and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the remembrance of them perish from their seed."
17,9,29,"Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim."
17,9,30,"And he sent letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, `with' words of peace and truth,"
17,9,31,"to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had ordained for themselves and for their seed, in the matter of the fastings and their cry."
17,9,32,"And the commandment of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book."
17,10,1,"And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea."
17,10,2,"And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?"
17,10,3,"For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the good of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed."
18,1,1,"There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and turned away from evil."
18,1,2,"And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters."
18,1,3,"His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east."
18,1,4,"And his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one upon his day; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them."
18,1,5,"And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually."
18,1,6,"Now it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan also came among them."
18,1,7,"And Jehovah said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it."
18,1,8,"And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil."
18,1,9,"Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?"
18,1,10,"Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land."
18,1,11,"But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will renounce thee to thy face."
18,1,12,"And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah."
18,1,13,"And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house,"
18,1,14,"that there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them;"
18,1,15,"and the Sabeans fell `upon them', and took them away: yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee."
18,1,16,"While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee."
18,1,17,"While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have taken them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee."
18,1,18,"While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house;"
18,1,19,"and, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee."
18,1,20,"Then Job arose, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped;"
18,1,21,"and he said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: Jehovah gave, and Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah."
18,1,22,"In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly."
18,2,1,"Again it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan came also among them to present himself before Jehovah."
18,2,2,"And Jehovah said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it."
18,2,3,"And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil: and he still holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause."
18,2,4,"And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life."
18,2,5,"But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce thee to thy face."
18,2,6,"And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thy hand; only spare his life."
18,2,7,"So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown."
18,2,8,"And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself therewith; and he sat among the ashes."
18,2,9,"Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still hold fast thine integrity? renounce God, and die."
18,2,10,"But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips."
18,2,11,"Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him and to comfort him."
18,2,12,"And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his robe, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven."
18,2,13,"So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great."
18,3,1,"After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day."
18,3,2,"And Job answered and said:"
18,3,3,"Let the day perish wherein I was born, And the night which said, There is a man-child conceived."
18,3,4,"Let that day be darkness; Let not God from above seek for it, Neither let the light shine upon it."
18,3,5,"Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own; Let a cloud dwell upon it; Let all that maketh black the day terrify it."
18,3,6,"As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it: Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; Let it not come into the number of the months."
18,3,7,"Lo, let that night be barren; Let no joyful voice come therein."
18,3,8,"Let them curse it that curse the day, Who are ready to rouse up leviathan."
18,3,9,"Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark: Let it look for light, but have none; Neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning:"
18,3,10,"Because it shut not up the doors of my `mother's' womb, Nor hid trouble from mine eyes."
18,3,11,"Why died I not from the womb? Why did I not give up the ghost when my mother bare me?"
18,3,12,"Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breast, that I should suck?"
18,3,13,"For now should I have lain down and been quiet; I should have slept; then had I been at rest,"
18,3,14,"With kings and counsellors of the earth, Who built up waste places for themselves;"
18,3,15,"Or with princes that had gold, Who filled their houses with silver:"
18,3,16,"Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been, As infants that never saw light."
18,3,17,"There the wicked cease from troubling; And there the weary are at rest."
18,3,18,"There the prisoners are at ease together; They hear not the voice of the taskmaster."
18,3,19,"The small and the great are there: And the servant is free from his master."
18,3,20,"Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, And life unto the bitter in soul;"
18,3,21,"Who long for death, but it cometh not, And dig for it more than for hid treasures;"
18,3,22,"Who rejoice exceedingly, And are glad, when they can find the grave?"
18,3,23,"`Why is light given' to a man whose way is hid, And whom God hath hedged in?"
18,3,24,"For my sighing cometh before I eat, And my groanings are poured out like water."
18,3,25,"For the thing which I fear cometh upon me, And that which I am afraid of cometh unto me."
18,3,26,"I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest; But trouble cometh."
18,4,1,"Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,"
18,4,2,"If one assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? But who can withhold himself from speaking?"
18,4,3,"Behold, thou hast instructed many, And thou hast strengthened the weak hands."
18,4,4,"Thy words have upholden him that was falling, And thou hast made firm the feeble knees."
18,4,5,"But now it is come unto thee, and thou faintest; It toucheth thee, and thou art troubled."
18,4,6,"Is not thy fear `of God' thy confidence, `And' the integrity of thy ways thy hope?"
18,4,7,"Remember, I pray thee, who `ever' perished, being innocent? Or where were the upright cut off?"
18,4,8,"According as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, And sow trouble, reap the same."
18,4,9,"By the breath of God they perish, And by the blast of his anger are they consumed."
18,4,10,"The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, And the teeth of the young lions, are broken."
18,4,11,"The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, And the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad."
18,4,12,"Now a thing was secretly brought to me, And mine ear received a whisper thereof."
18,4,13,"In thoughts from the visions of the night, When deep sleep falleth on men,"
18,4,14,"Fear came upon me, and trembling, Which made all my bones to shake."
18,4,15,"Then a spirit passed before my face; The hair of my flesh stood up."
18,4,16,"It stood still, but I could not discern the appearance thereof; A form was before mine eyes: `There was' silence, and I heard a voice, `saying',"
18,4,17,"Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?"
18,4,18,"Behold, he putteth no trust in his servants; And his angels he chargeth with folly:"
18,4,19,"How much more them that dwell in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, Who are crushed before the moth!"
18,4,20,"Betwixt morning and evening they are destroyed: They perish for ever without any regarding it."
18,4,21,"Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them? They die, and that without wisdom."
18,5,1,"Call now; is there any that will answer thee? And to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn?"
18,5,2,"For vexation killeth the foolish man, And jealousy slayeth the silly one."
18,5,3,"I have seen the foolish taking root: But suddenly I cursed his habitation."
18,5,4,"His children are far from safety, And they are crushed in the gate, Neither is there any to deliver them:"
18,5,5,"Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, And taketh it even out of the thorns; And the snare gapeth for their substance."
18,5,6,"For affliction cometh not forth from the dust, Neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;"
18,5,7,"But man is born unto trouble, As the sparks fly upward."
18,5,8,"But as for me, I would seek unto God, And unto God would I commit my cause;"
18,5,9,"Who doeth great things and unsearchable, Marvellous things without number:"
18,5,10,"Who giveth rain upon the earth, And sendeth waters upon the fields;"
18,5,11,"So that he setteth up on high those that are low, And those that mourn are exalted to safety."
18,5,12,"He frustrateth the devices of the crafty, So that their hands cannot perform their enterprise."
18,5,13,"He taketh the wise in their own craftiness; And the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong."
18,5,14,"They meet with darkness in the day-time, And grope at noonday as in the night."
18,5,15,"But he saveth from the sword of their mouth, Even the needy from the hand of the mighty."
18,5,16,"So the poor hath hope, And iniquity stoppeth her mouth."
18,5,17,"Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty."
18,5,18,"For he maketh sore, and bindeth up; He woundeth, and his hands make whole."
18,5,19,"He will deliver thee in six troubles; Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee."
18,5,20,"In famine he will redeem thee from death; And in war from the power of the sword."
18,5,21,"Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue; Neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh."
18,5,22,"At destruction and dearth thou shalt laugh; Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth."
18,5,23,"For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field; And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee."
18,5,24,"And thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace; And thou shalt visit thy fold, and shalt miss nothing."
18,5,25,"Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, And thine offspring as the grass of the earth."
18,5,26,"Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, Like as a shock of grain cometh in in its season."
18,5,27,"Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; Hear it, and know thou it for thy good."
18,6,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
18,6,2,"Oh that my vexation were but weighed, And all my calamity laid in the balances!"
18,6,3,"For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas: Therefore have my words been rash."
18,6,4,"For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, The poison whereof my spirit drinketh up: The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me."
18,6,5,"Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? Or loweth the ox over his fodder?"
18,6,6,"Can that which hath no savor be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?"
18,6,7,"My soul refuseth to touch `them'; They are as loathsome food to me."
18,6,8,"Oh that I might have my request; And that God would grant `me' the thing that I long for!"
18,6,9,"Even that it would please God to crush me; That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!"
18,6,10,"And be it still my consolation, Yea, let me exult in pain that spareth not, That I have not denied the words of the Holy One."
18,6,11,"What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is mine end, that I should be patient?"
18,6,12,"Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh of brass?"
18,6,13,"Is it not that I have no help in me, And that wisdom is driven quite from me?"
18,6,14,"To him that is ready to faint kindness `should be showed' from his friend; Even to him that forsaketh the fear of the Almighty."
18,6,15,"My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, As the channel of brooks that pass away;"
18,6,16,"Which are black by reason of the ice, `And' wherein the snow hideth itself:"
18,6,17,"What time they wax warm, they vanish; When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place."
18,6,18,"The caravans `that travel' by the way of them turn aside; They go up into the waste, and perish."
18,6,19,"The caravans of Tema looked, The companies of Sheba waited for them."
18,6,20,"They were put to shame because they had hoped; They came thither, and were confounded."
18,6,21,"For now ye are nothing; Ye see a terror, and are afraid."
18,6,22,"Did I say, Give unto me? Or, Offer a present for me of your substance?"
18,6,23,"Or, Deliver me from the adversary's hand? Or, Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?"
18,6,24,"Teach me, and I will hold my peace; And cause me to understand wherein I have erred."
18,6,25,"How forcible are words of uprightness! But your reproof, what doth it reprove?"
18,6,26,"Do ye think to reprove words, Seeing that the speeches of one that is desperate are as wind?"
18,6,27,"Yea, ye would cast `lots' upon the fatherless, And make merchandise of your friend."
18,6,28,"Now therefore be pleased to look upon me; For surely I shall not lie to your face."
18,6,29,"Return, I pray you, let there be no injustice; Yea, return again, my cause is righteous."
18,6,30,"Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern mischievous things?"
18,7,1,"Is there not a warfare to man upon earth? And are not his days like the days of a hireling?"
18,7,2,"As a servant that earnestly desireth the shadow, And as a hireling that looketh for his wages:"
18,7,3,"So am I made to possess months of misery, And wearisome nights are appointed to me."
18,7,4,"When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? And I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day."
18,7,5,"My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; My skin closeth up, and breaketh out afresh."
18,7,6,"My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, And are spent without hope."
18,7,7,"Oh remember that my life is a breath: Mine eye shall no more see good."
18,7,8,"The eye of him that seeth me shall behold me no more; Thine eyes shall be upon me, but I shall not be."
18,7,9,"As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away, So he that goeth down to Sheol shall come up no more."
18,7,10,"He shall return no more to his house, Neither shall his place know him any more."
18,7,11,"Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul."
18,7,12,"Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, That thou settest a watch over me?"
18,7,13,"When I say, My bed shall comfort me, My couch shall ease my complaint;"
18,7,14,"Then thou scarest me with dreams, And terrifiest me through visions:"
18,7,15,"So that my soul chooseth strangling, And death rather than `these' my bones."
18,7,16,"I loathe `my life'; I would not live alway: Let me alone; for my days are vanity."
18,7,17,"What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him, And that thou shouldest set thy mind upon him,"
18,7,18,"And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, And try him every moment?"
18,7,19,"How long wilt thou not look away from me, Nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?"
18,7,20,"If I have sinned, what do I unto thee, O thou watcher of men? Why hast thou set me as a mark for thee, So that I am a burden to myself?"
18,7,21,"And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? For now shall I lie down in the dust; And thou wilt seek me diligently, but I shall not be."
18,8,1,"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,"
18,8,2,"How long wilt thou speak these things? And `how long' shall the words of thy mouth be `like' a mighty wind?"
18,8,3,"Doth God pervert justice? Or doth the Almighty pervert righteousness?"
18,8,4,"If thy children have sinned against him, And he hath delivered them into the hand of their transgression;"
18,8,5,"If thou wouldest seek diligently unto God, And make thy supplication to the Almighty;"
18,8,6,"If thou wert pure and upright: Surely now he would awake for thee, And make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous."
18,8,7,"And though thy beginning was small, Yet thy latter end would greatly increase."
18,8,8,"For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, And apply thyself to that which their fathers have searched out:"
18,8,9,"(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, Because our days upon earth are a shadow);"
18,8,10,"Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, And utter words out of their heart?"
18,8,11,"Can the rush grow up without mire? Can the flag grow without water?"
18,8,12,"Whilst it is yet in its greenness, `and' not cut down, It withereth before any `other' herb."
18,8,13,"So are the paths of all that forget God; And the hope of the godless man shall perish:"
18,8,14,"Whose confidence shall break in sunder, And whose trust is a spider's web."
18,8,15,"He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: He shall hold fast thereby, but it shall not endure."
18,8,16,"He is green before the sun, And his shoots go forth over his garden."
18,8,17,"His roots are wrapped about the `stone' -heap, He beholdeth the place of stones."
18,8,18,"If he be destroyed from his place, Then it shall deny him, `saying', I have not seen thee."
18,8,19,"Behold, this is the joy of his way; And out of the earth shall others spring."
18,8,20,"Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, Neither will he uphold the evil-doers."
18,8,21,"He will yet fill thy mouth with laughter, And thy lips with shouting."
18,8,22,"They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; And the tent of the wicked shall be no more."
18,9,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
18,9,2,"Of a truth I know that it is so: But how can man be just with God?"
18,9,3,"If he be pleased to contend with him, He cannot answer him one of a thousand."
18,9,4,"`He is' wise in heart, and mighty in strength: Who hath hardened himself against him, and prospered?-"
18,9,5,"`Him' that removeth the mountains, and they know it not, When he overturneth them in his anger;"
18,9,6,"That shaketh the earth out of its place, And the pillars thereof tremble;"
18,9,7,"That commandeth the sun, and it riseth not, And sealeth up the stars;"
18,9,8,"That alone stretcheth out the heavens, And treadeth upon the waves of the sea;"
18,9,9,"That maketh the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, And the chambers of the south;"
18,9,10,"That doeth great things past finding out, Yea, marvellous things without number."
18,9,11,"Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: He passeth on also, but I perceive him not."
18,9,12,"Behold, he seizeth `the prey', who can hinder him? Who will say unto him, What doest thou?"
18,9,13,"God will not withdraw his anger; The helpers of Rahab do stoop under him."
18,9,14,"How much less shall I answer him, And choose out my words `to reason' with him?"
18,9,15,"Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer; I would make supplication to my judge."
18,9,16,"If I had called, and he had answered me, Yet would I not believe that he hearkened unto my voice."
18,9,17,"For he breaketh me with a tempest, And multiplieth my wounds without cause."
18,9,18,"He will not suffer me to take my breath, But filleth me with bitterness."
18,9,19,"If `we speak' of strength, lo, `he is' mighty! And if of justice, Who, `saith he', will summon me?"
18,9,20,"Though I be righteous, mine own mouth shall condemn me: Though I be perfect, it shall prove me perverse."
18,9,21,"I am perfect; I regard not myself; I despise my life."
18,9,22,"It is all one; therefore I say, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked."
18,9,23,"If the scourge slay suddenly, He will mock at the trial of the innocent."
18,9,24,"The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; He covereth the faces of the judges thereof: If `it be' not `he', who then is it?"
18,9,25,"Now my days are swifter than a post: They flee away, they see no good,"
18,9,26,"They are passed away as the swift ships; As the eagle that swoopeth on the prey."
18,9,27,"If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will put off my `sad' countenance, and be of good cheer;"
18,9,28,"I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent."
18,9,29,"I shall be condemned; Why then do I labor in vain?"
18,9,30,"If I wash myself with snow water, And make my hands never so clean;"
18,9,31,"Yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch, And mine own clothes shall abhor me."
18,9,32,"For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, That we should come together in judgment."
18,9,33,"There is no umpire betwixt us, That might lay his hand upon us both."
18,9,34,"Let him take his rod away from me, And let not his terror make me afraid:"
18,9,35,"Then would I speak, and not fear him; For I am not so in myself."
18,10,1,"My soul is weary of my life; I will give free course to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul."
18,10,2,"I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; Show me wherefore thou contendest with me."
18,10,3,"Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, That thou shouldest despise the work of thy hands, And shine upon the counsel of the wicked?"
18,10,4,"Hast thou eyes of flesh? Or seest thou as man seeth?"
18,10,5,"Are thy days as the days of man, Or thy years as man's days,"
18,10,6,"That thou inquirest after mine iniquity, And searchest after my sin,"
18,10,7,"Although thou knowest that I am not wicked, And there is none that can deliver out of thy hand?"
18,10,8,"Thy hands have framed me and fashioned me Together round about; yet thou dost destroy me."
18,10,9,"Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast fashioned me as clay; And wilt thou bring me into dust again?"
18,10,10,"Hast thou not poured me out as milk, And curdled me like cheese?"
18,10,11,"Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, And knit me together with bones and sinews."
18,10,12,"Thou hast granted me life and lovingkindness; And thy visitation hath preserved my spirit."
18,10,13,"Yet these things thou didst hide in thy heart; I know that this is with thee:"
18,10,14,"If I sin, then thou markest me, And thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity."
18,10,15,"If I be wicked, woe unto me; And if I be righteous, yet shall I not lift up my head; Being filled with ignominy, And looking upon mine affliction."
18,10,16,"And if `my head' exalt itself, thou huntest me as a lion; And again thou showest thyself marvellous upon me."
18,10,17,"Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, And increasest thine indignation upon me: Changes and warfare are with me."
18,10,18,"Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me."
18,10,19,"I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave."
18,10,20,"Are not my days few? cease then, And let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,"
18,10,21,"Before I go whence I shall not return, `Even' to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death;"
18,10,22,"The land dark as midnight, `The land' of the shadow of death, without any order, And where the light is as midnight."
18,11,1,"Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,"
18,11,2,"Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man full of talk be justified?"
18,11,3,"Should thy boastings make men hold their peace? And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?"
18,11,4,"For thou sayest, My doctrine is pure, And I am clean in thine eyes."
18,11,5,"But oh that God would speak, And open his lips against thee,"
18,11,6,"And that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom! For he is manifold in understanding. Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth."
18,11,7,"Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?"
18,11,8,"It is high as heaven; what canst thou do? Deeper than Sheol; what canst thou know?"
18,11,9,"The measure thereof is longer than the earth, And broader than the sea."
18,11,10,"If he pass through, and shut up, And all unto judgment, then who can hinder him?"
18,11,11,"For he knoweth false men: He seeth iniquity also, even though he consider it not."
18,11,12,"But vain man is void of understanding, Yea, man is born `as' a wild ass's colt."
18,11,13,"If thou set thy heart aright, And stretch out thy hands toward him;"
18,11,14,"If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away, And let not unrighteousness dwell in thy tents."
18,11,15,"Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; Yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:"
18,11,16,"For thou shalt forget thy misery; Thou shalt remember it as waters that are passed away,"
18,11,17,"And `thy' life shall be clearer than the noonday; Though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning."
18,11,18,"And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; Yea, thou shalt search `about thee', and shalt take thy rest in safety."
18,11,19,"Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; Yea, many shall make suit unto thee."
18,11,20,"But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, And they shall have no way to flee; And their hope shall be the giving up of the ghost."
18,12,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
18,12,2,"No doubt but ye are the people, And wisdom shall die with you."
18,12,3,"But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: Yea, who knoweth not such things as these?"
18,12,4,"I am as one that is a laughing-stock to his neighbor, I who called upon God, and he answered: The just, the perfect man is a laughing-stock."
18,12,5,"In the thought of him that is at ease there is contempt for misfortune; It is ready for them whose foot slippeth."
18,12,6,"The tents of robbers prosper, And they that provoke God are secure; Into whose hand God bringeth `abundantly'."
18,12,7,"But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; And the birds of the heavens, and they shall tell thee:"
18,12,8,"Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee; And the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee."
18,12,9,"Who knoweth not in all these, That the hand of Jehovah hath wrought this,"
18,12,10,"In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, And the breath of all mankind?"
18,12,11,"Doth not the ear try words, Even as the palate tasteth its food?"
18,12,12,"With aged men is wisdom, And in length of days understanding."
18,12,13,"With `God' is wisdom and might; He hath counsel and understanding."
18,12,14,"Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again; He shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening."
18,12,15,"Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up; Again, he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth."
18,12,16,"With him is strength and wisdom; The deceived and the deceiver are his."
18,12,17,"He leadeth counsellors away stripped, And judges maketh he fools."
18,12,18,"He looseth the bond of kings, And he bindeth their loins with a girdle."
18,12,19,"He leadeth priests away stripped, And overthroweth the mighty."
18,12,20,"He removeth the speech of the trusty, And taketh away the understanding of the elders."
18,12,21,"He poureth contempt upon princes, And looseth the belt of the strong."
18,12,22,"He uncovereth deep things out of darkness, And bringeth out to light the shadow of death."
18,12,23,"He increaseth the nations, and he destroyeth them: He enlargeth the nations, and he leadeth them captive."
18,12,24,"He taketh away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth, And causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way."
18,12,25,"They grope in the dark without light; And he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man."
18,13,1,"Lo, mine eye hath seen all `this', Mine ear hath heard and understood it."
18,13,2,"What ye know, `the same' do I know also: I am not inferior unto you."
18,13,3,"Surely I would speak to the Almighty, And I desire to reason with God."
18,13,4,"But ye are forgers of lies; Ye are all physicians of no value."
18,13,5,"Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace! And it would be your wisdom."
18,13,6,"Hear now my reasoning, And hearken to the pleadings of my lips."
18,13,7,"Will ye speak unrighteously for God, And talk deceitfully for him?"
18,13,8,"Will ye show partiality to him? Will ye contend for God?"
18,13,9,"Is it good that he should search you out? Or as one deceiveth a man, will ye deceive him?"
18,13,10,"He will surely reprove you If ye do secretly show partiality."
18,13,11,"Shall not his majesty make you afraid, And his dread fall upon you?"
18,13,12,"Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, Your defences are defences of clay."
18,13,13,"Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak; And let come on me what will."
18,13,14,"Wherefore should I take my flesh in my teeth, And put my life in my hand?"
18,13,15,"Behold, he will slay me; I have no hope: Nevertheless I will maintain my ways before him."
18,13,16,"This also shall be my salvation, That a godless man shall not come before him."
18,13,17,"Hear diligently my speech, And let my declaration be in your ears."
18,13,18,"Behold now, I have set my cause in order; I know that I am righteous."
18,13,19,"Who is he that will contend with me? For then would I hold my peace and give up the ghost."
18,13,20,"Only do not two things unto me; Then will I not hide myself from thy face:"
18,13,21,"Withdraw thy hand far from me; And let not thy terror make me afraid."
18,13,22,"Then call thou, and I will answer; Or let me speak, and answer thou me."
18,13,23,"How many are mine iniquities and sins? Make me to know my transgression and my sin."
18,13,24,"Wherefore hidest thou thy face, And holdest me for thine enemy?"
18,13,25,"Wilt thou harass a driven leaf? And wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?"
18,13,26,"For thou writest bitter things against me, And makest me to inherit the iniquities of my youth:"
18,13,27,"Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, And markest all my paths; Thou settest a bound to the soles of my feet:"
18,13,28,"Though I am like a rotten thing that consumeth, Like a garment that is moth-eaten."
18,14,1,"Man, that is born of a woman, Is of few days, and full of trouble."
18,14,2,"He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: He fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not."
18,14,3,"And dost thou open thine eyes upon such a one, And bringest me into judgment with thee?"
18,14,4,"Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one."
18,14,5,"Seeing his days are determined, The number of his months is with thee, And thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;"
18,14,6,"Look away from him, that he may rest, Till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day."
18,14,7,"For there is hope of a tree, If it be cut down, that it will sprout again, And that the tender branch thereof will not cease."
18,14,8,"Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, And the stock thereof die in the ground;"
18,14,9,"Yet through the scent of water it will bud, And put forth boughs like a plant."
18,14,10,"But man dieth, and is laid low: Yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?"
18,14,11,"`As' the waters fail from the sea, And the river wasteth and drieth up;"
18,14,12,"So man lieth down and riseth not: Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, Nor be roused out of their sleep."
18,14,13,"Oh that thou wouldest hide me in Sheol, That thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, That thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!"
18,14,14,"If a man die, shall he live `again'? All the days of my warfare would I wait, Till my release should come."
18,14,15,"Thou wouldest call, and I would answer thee: Thou wouldest have a desire to the work of thy hands."
18,14,16,"But now thou numberest my steps: Dost thou not watch over my sin?"
18,14,17,"My transgression is sealed up in a bag, And thou fastenest up mine iniquity."
18,14,18,"But the mountain falling cometh to nought; And the rock is removed out of its place;"
18,14,19,"The waters wear the stones; The overflowings thereof wash away the dust of the earth: So thou destroyest the hope of man."
18,14,20,"Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth; Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away."
18,14,21,"His sons come to honor, and he knoweth it not; And they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them."
18,14,22,"But his flesh upon him hath pain, And his soul within him mourneth."
18,15,1,"Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,"
18,15,2,"Should a wise man make answer with vain knowledge, And fill himself with the east wind?"
18,15,3,"Should he reason with unprofitable talk, Or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?"
18,15,4,"Yea, thou doest away with fear, And hinderest devotion before God."
18,15,5,"For thine iniquity teacheth thy mouth, And thou choosest the tongue of the crafty."
18,15,6,"Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I; Yea, thine own lips testify against thee."
18,15,7,"Art thou the first man that was born? Or wast thou brought forth before the hills?"
18,15,8,"Hast thou heard the secret counsel of God? And dost thou limit wisdom to thyself?"
18,15,9,"What knowest thou, that we know not? What understandest thou, which is not in us?"
18,15,10,"With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men, Much elder than thy father."
18,15,11,"Are the consolations of God too small for thee, Even the word that is gentle toward thee?"
18,15,12,"Why doth thy heart carry thee away? And why do thine eyes flash,"
18,15,13,"That against God thou turnest thy spirit, And lettest words go out of thy mouth?"
18,15,14,"What is man, that he should be clean? And he that is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?"
18,15,15,"Behold, he putteth no trust in his holy ones; Yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight:"
18,15,16,"How much less one that is abominable and corrupt, A man that drinketh iniquity like water!"
18,15,17,"I will show thee, hear thou me; And that which I have seen I will declare:"
18,15,18,"(Which wise men have told From their fathers, and have not hid it;"
18,15,19,"Unto whom alone the land was given, And no stranger passed among them):"
18,15,20,"The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, Even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor."
18,15,21,"A sound of terrors is in his ears; In prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him."
18,15,22,"He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, And he is waited for of the sword."
18,15,23,"He wandereth abroad for bread, `saying', Where is it? He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand."
18,15,24,"Distress and anguish make him afraid; They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle."
18,15,25,"Because he hath stretched out his hand against God, And behaveth himself proudly against the Almighty;"
18,15,26,"He runneth upon him with a `stiff' neck, With the thick bosses of his bucklers;"
18,15,27,"Because he hath covered his face with his fatness, And gathered fat upon his loins;"
18,15,28,"And he hath dwelt in desolate cities, In houses which no man inhabited, Which were ready to become heaps;"
18,15,29,"He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, Neither shall their possessions be extended on the earth."
18,15,30,"He shall not depart out of darkness; The flame shall dry up his branches, And by the breath of `God's' mouth shall he go away."
18,15,31,"Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself; For vanity shall be his recompense."
18,15,32,"It shall be accomplished before his time, And his branch shall not be green."
18,15,33,"He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, And shall cast off his flower as the olive-tree."
18,15,34,"For the company of the godless shall be barren, And fire shall consume the tents of bribery."
18,15,35,"They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity, And their heart prepareth deceit."
18,16,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
18,16,2,"I have heard many such things: Miserable comforters are ye all."
18,16,3,"Shall vain words have an end? Or what provoketh thee that thou answerest?"
18,16,4,"I also could speak as ye do; If your soul were in my soul's stead, I could join words together against you, And shake my head at you."
18,16,5,"`But' I would strengthen you with my mouth, And the solace of my lips would assuage `your grief'."
18,16,6,"Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged; And though I forbear, what am I eased?"
18,16,7,"But now he hath made me weary: Thou hast made desolate all my company."
18,16,8,"And thou hast laid fast hold on me, `which' is a witness `against me': And my leanness riseth up against me, It testifieth to my face."
18,16,9,"He hath torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me; He hath gnashed upon me with his teeth: Mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me."
18,16,10,"They have gaped upon me with their mouth; They have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully: They gather themselves together against me."
18,16,11,"God delivereth me to the ungodly, And casteth me into the hands of the wicked."
18,16,12,"I was at ease, and he brake me asunder; Yea, he hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces: He hath also set me up for his mark."
18,16,13,"His archers compass me round about; He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; He poureth out my gall upon the ground."
18,16,14,"He breaketh me with breach upon breach; He runneth upon me like a giant."
18,16,15,"I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, And have laid my horn in the dust."
18,16,16,"My face is red with weeping, And on my eyelids is the shadow of death;"
18,16,17,"Although there is no violence in my hands, And my prayer is pure."
18,16,18,"O earth, cover not thou my blood, And let my cry have no `resting' -place."
18,16,19,"Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, And he that voucheth for me is on high."
18,16,20,"My friends scoff at me: `But' mine eye poureth out tears unto God,"
18,16,21,"That he would maintain the right of a man with God, And of a son of man with his neighbor!"
18,16,22,"For when a few years are come, I shall go the way whence I shall not return."
18,17,1,"My spirit is consumed, my days are extinct, The grave is `ready' for me."
18,17,2,"Surely there are mockers with me, And mine eye dwelleth upon their provocation."
18,17,3,"Give now a pledge, be surety for me with thyself; Who is there that will strike hands with me?"
18,17,4,"For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: Therefore shalt thou not exalt `them'."
18,17,5,"He that denounceth his friends for a prey, Even the eyes of his children shall fail."
18,17,6,"But he hath made me a byword of the people; And they spit in my face."
18,17,7,"Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, And all my members are as a shadow."
18,17,8,"Upright men shall be astonished at this, And the innocent shall stir up himself against the godless."
18,17,9,"Yet shall the righteous hold on his way, And he that hath clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger."
18,17,10,"But as for you all, come on now again; And I shall not find a wise man among you."
18,17,11,"My days are past, my purposes are broken off, Even the thoughts of my heart."
18,17,12,"They change the night into day: The light, `say they', is near unto the darkness."
18,17,13,"If I look for Sheol as my house; If I have spread my couch in the darkness;"
18,17,14,"If I have said to corruption, Thou art my father; To the worm, `Thou art' my mother, and my sister;"
18,17,15,"Where then is my hope? And as for my hope, who shall see it?"
18,17,16,"It shall go down to the bars of Sheol, When once there is rest in the dust."
18,18,1,"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,"
18,18,2,"How long will ye hunt for words? Consider, and afterwards we will speak."
18,18,3,"Wherefore are we counted as beasts, `And' are become unclean in your sight?"
18,18,4,"Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger, Shall the earth be forsaken for thee? Or shall the rock be removed out of its place?"
18,18,5,"Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, And the spark of his fire shall not shine."
18,18,6,"The light shall be dark in his tent, And his lamp above him shall be put out."
18,18,7,"The steps of his strength shall be straitened, And his own counsel shall cast him down."
18,18,8,"For he is cast into a net by his own feet, And he walketh upon the toils."
18,18,9,"A gin shall take `him' by the heel, `And' a snare shall lay hold on him."
18,18,10,"A noose is hid for him in the ground, And a trap for him in the way."
18,18,11,"Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, And shall chase him at his heels."
18,18,12,"His strength shall be hunger-bitten, And calamity shall be ready at his side."
18,18,13,"The members of his body shall be devoured, `Yea', the first-born of death shall devour his members."
18,18,14,"He shall be rooted out of his tent where he trusteth; And he shall be brought to the king of terrors."
18,18,15,"There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his: Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation."
18,18,16,"His roots shall be dried up beneath, And above shall his branch be cut off."
18,18,17,"His remembrance shall perish from the earth, And he shall have no name in the street."
18,18,18,"He shall be driven from light into darkness, And chased out of the world."
18,18,19,"He shall have neither son nor son's son among his people, Nor any remaining where he sojourned."
18,18,20,"They that come after shall be astonished at his day, As they that went before were affrighted."
18,18,21,"Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous, And this is the place of him that knoweth not God."
18,19,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
18,19,2,"How long will ye vex my soul, And break me in pieces with words?"
18,19,3,"These ten times have ye reproached me: Ye are not ashamed that ye deal hardly with me."
18,19,4,"And be it indeed that I have erred, Mine error remaineth with myself."
18,19,5,"If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, And plead against me my reproach;"
18,19,6,"Know now that God hath subverted me `in my cause', And hath compassed me with his net."
18,19,7,"Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry for help, but there is no justice."
18,19,8,"He hath walled up my way that I cannot pass, And hath set darkness in my paths."
18,19,9,"He hath stripped me of my glory, And taken the crown from my head."
18,19,10,"He hath broken me down on every side, and I am gone; And my hope hath he plucked up like a tree."
18,19,11,"He hath also kindled his wrath against me, And he counteth me unto him as `one of' his adversaries."
18,19,12,"His troops come on together, And cast up their way against me, And encamp round about my tent."
18,19,13,"He hath put my brethren far from me, And mine acquaintance are wholly estranged from me."
18,19,14,"My kinsfolk have failed, And my familiar friends have forgotten me."
18,19,15,"They that dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger; I am an alien in their sight."
18,19,16,"I call unto my servant, and he giveth me no answer, `Though' I entreat him with my mouth."
18,19,17,"My breath is strange to my wife, And my supplication to the children of mine own mother."
18,19,18,"Even young children despise me; If I arise, they speak against me."
18,19,19,"All my familiar friends abhor me, And they whom I loved are turned against me."
18,19,20,"My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, And I am escaped with the skin of my teeth."
18,19,21,"Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; For the hand of God hath touched me."
18,19,22,"Why do ye persecute me as God, And are not satisfied with my flesh?"
18,19,23,"Oh that my words were now written! Oh that they were inscribed in a book!"
18,19,24,"That with an iron pen and lead They were graven in the rock for ever!"
18,19,25,"But as for me I know that my Redeemer liveth, And at last he will stand up upon the earth:"
18,19,26,"And after my skin, `even' this `body', is destroyed, Then without my flesh shall I see God;"
18,19,27,"Whom I, even I, shall see, on my side, And mine eyes shall behold, and not as a stranger. My heart is consumed within me."
18,19,28,"If ye say, How we will persecute him! And that the root of the matter is found in me;"
18,19,29,"Be ye afraid of the sword: For wrath `bringeth' the punishments of the sword, That ye may know there is a judgment."
18,20,1,"Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,"
18,20,2,"Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me, Even by reason of my haste that is in me."
18,20,3,"I have heard the reproof which putteth me to shame; And the spirit of my understanding answereth me."
18,20,4,"Knowest thou `not' this of old time, Since man was placed upon earth,"
18,20,5,"That the triumphing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the godless but for a moment?"
18,20,6,"Though his height mount up to the heavens, And his head reach unto the clouds;"
18,20,7,"Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: They that have seen him shall say, Where is he?"
18,20,8,"He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night."
18,20,9,"The eye which saw him shall see him no more; Neither shall his place any more behold him."
18,20,10,"His children shall seek the favor of the poor, And his hands shall give back his wealth."
18,20,11,"His bones are full of his youth, But it shall lie down with him in the dust."
18,20,12,"Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, Though he hide it under his tongue,"
18,20,13,"Though he spare it, and will not let it go, But keep it still within his mouth;"
18,20,14,"Yet his food in his bowels is turned, It is the gall of asps within him."
18,20,15,"He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again; God will cast them out of his belly."
18,20,16,"He shall suck the poison of asps: The viper's tongue shall slay him."
18,20,17,"He shall not look upon the rivers, The flowing streams of honey and butter."
18,20,18,"That which he labored for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down; According to the substance that he hath gotten, he shall not rejoice."
18,20,19,"For he hath oppressed and forsaken the poor; He hath violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up."
18,20,20,"Because he knew no quietness within him, He shall not save aught of that wherein he delighteth."
18,20,21,"There was nothing left that he devoured not; Therefore his prosperity shall not endure."
18,20,22,"In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: The hand of every one that is in misery shall come upon him."
18,20,23,"When he is about to fill his belly, `God' will cast the fierceness of his wrath upon him, And will rain it upon him while he is eating."
18,20,24,"He shall flee from the iron weapon, And the bow of brass shall strike him through."
18,20,25,"He draweth it forth, and it cometh out of his body; Yea, the glittering point cometh out of his gall: Terrors are upon him."
18,20,26,"All darkness is laid up for his treasures: A fire not blown `by man' shall devour him; It shall consume that which is left in his tent."
18,20,27,"The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, And the earth shall rise up against him."
18,20,28,"The increase of his house shall depart; `His goods' shall flow away in the day of his wrath."
18,20,29,"This is the portion of a wicked man from God, And the heritage appointed unto him by God."
18,21,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
18,21,2,"Hear diligently my speech; And let this be your consolations."
18,21,3,"Suffer me, and I also will speak; And after that I have spoken, mock on."
18,21,4,"As for me, is my complaint to man? And why should I not be impatient?"
18,21,5,"Mark me, and be astonished, And lay your hand upon your mouth."
18,21,6,"Even when I remember I am troubled, And horror taketh hold on my flesh."
18,21,7,"Wherefore do the wicked live, Become old, yea, wax mighty in power?"
18,21,8,"Their seed is established with them in their sight, And their offspring before their eyes."
18,21,9,"Their houses are safe from fear, Neither is the rod of God upon them."
18,21,10,"Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; Their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf."
18,21,11,"They send forth their little ones like a flock, And their children dance."
18,21,12,"They sing to the timbrel and harp, And rejoice at the sound of the pipe."
18,21,13,"They spend their days in prosperity, And in a moment they go down to Sheol."
18,21,14,"And they say unto God, Depart from us; For we desire not the knowledge of thy ways."
18,21,15,"What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? And what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?"
18,21,16,"Lo, their prosperity is not in their hand: The counsel of the wicked is far from me."
18,21,17,"How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? That their calamity cometh upon them? That `God' distributeth sorrows in his anger?"
18,21,18,"That they are as stubble before the wind, And as chaff that the storm carrieth away?"
18,21,19,"`Ye say', God layeth up his iniquity for his children. Let him recompense it unto himself, that he may know it:"
18,21,20,"Let his own eyes see his destruction, And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty."
18,21,21,"For what careth he for his house after him, When the number of his months is cut off?"
18,21,22,"Shall any teach God knowledge, Seeing he judgeth those that are high?"
18,21,23,"One dieth in his full strength, Being wholly at ease and quiet:"
18,21,24,"His pails are full of milk, And the marrow of his bones is moistened."
18,21,25,"And another dieth in bitterness of soul, And never tasteth of good."
18,21,26,"They lie down alike in the dust, And the worm covereth them."
18,21,27,"Behold, I know your thoughts, And the devices wherewith ye would wrong me."
18,21,28,"For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? And where is the tent wherein the wicked dwelt?"
18,21,29,"Have ye not asked wayfaring men? And do ye not know their evidences,"
18,21,30,"That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity? That they are led forth to the day of wrath?"
18,21,31,"Who shall declare his way to his face? And who shall repay him what he hath done?"
18,21,32,"Yet shall he be borne to the grave, And men shall keep watch over the tomb."
18,21,33,"The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, And all men shall draw after him, As there were innumerable before him."
18,21,34,"How then comfort ye me in vain, Seeing in your answers there remaineth `only' falsehood?"
18,22,1,"Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,"
18,22,2,"Can a man be profitable unto God? Surely he that is wise is profitable unto himself."
18,22,3,"Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? Or is it gain `to him', that thou makest thy ways perfect?"
18,22,4,"Is it for thy fear `of him' that he reproveth thee, That he entereth with thee into judgment?"
18,22,5,"Is not thy wickedness great? Neither is there any end to thine iniquities."
18,22,6,"For thou hast taken pledges of thy brother for nought, And stripped the naked of their clothing."
18,22,7,"Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, And thou hast withholden bread from the hungry."
18,22,8,"But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; And the honorable man, he dwelt in it."
18,22,9,"Thou hast sent widows away empty, And the arms of the fatherless have been broken."
18,22,10,"Therefore snares are round about thee, And sudden fear troubleth thee,"
18,22,11,"Or darkness, so that thou canst not see, And abundance of waters cover thee."
18,22,12,"Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the height of the stars, how high they are!"
18,22,13,"And thou sayest, What doth God know? Can he judge through the thick darkness?"
18,22,14,"Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he seeth not; And he walketh on the vault of heaven."
18,22,15,"Wilt thou keep the old way Which wicked men have trodden?"
18,22,16,"Who were snatched away before their time, Whose foundation was poured out as a stream,"
18,22,17,"Who said unto God, Depart from us; And, What can the Almighty do for us?"
18,22,18,"Yet he filled their houses with good things: But the counsel of the wicked is far from me."
18,22,19,"The righteous see it, and are glad; And the innocent laugh them to scorn,"
18,22,20,"`Saying', Surely they that did rise up against us are cut off, And the remnant of them the fire hath consumed."
18,22,21,"Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: Thereby good shall come unto thee."
18,22,22,"Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, And lay up his words in thy heart."
18,22,23,"If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, If thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents."
18,22,24,"And lay thou `thy' treasure in the dust, And `the gold of' Ophir among the stones of the brooks;"
18,22,25,"And the Almighty will be thy treasure, And precious silver unto thee."
18,22,26,"For then shalt thou delight thyself in the Almighty, And shalt lift up thy face unto God."
18,22,27,"Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he will hear thee; And thou shalt pay thy vows."
18,22,28,"Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee; And light shall shine upon thy ways."
18,22,29,"When they cast `thee' down, thou shalt say, `There is' lifting up; And the humble person he will save."
18,22,30,"He will deliver `even' him that is not innocent: Yea, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of thy hands."
18,23,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
18,23,2,"Even to-day is my complaint rebellious: My stroke is heavier than my groaning."
18,23,3,"Oh that I knew where I might find him! That I might come even to his seat!"
18,23,4,"I would set my cause in order before him, And fill my mouth with arguments."
18,23,5,"I would know the words which he would answer me, And understand what he would say unto me."
18,23,6,"Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? Nay; but he would give heed unto me."
18,23,7,"There the upright might reason with him; So should I be delivered for ever from my judge."
18,23,8,"Behold, I go forward, but he is not `there'; And backward, but I cannot perceive him;"
18,23,9,"On the left hand, when he doth work, but I cannot behold him; He hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him."
18,23,10,"But he knoweth the way that I take; When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold."
18,23,11,"My foot hath held fast to his steps; His way have I kept, and turned not aside."
18,23,12,"I have not gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food."
18,23,13,"But he is in one `mind', and who can turn him? And what his soul desireth, even that he doeth."
18,23,14,"For he performeth that which is appointed for me: And many such things are with him."
18,23,15,"Therefore am I terrified at his presence; When I consider, I am afraid of him."
18,23,16,"For God hath made my heart faint, And the Almighty hath terrified me;"
18,23,17,"Because I was not cut off before the darkness, Neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face."
18,24,1,"Why are times not laid up by the Almighty? And why do not they that know him see his days?"
18,24,2,"There are that remove the landmarks; They violently take away flocks, and feed them."
18,24,3,"They drive away the ass of the fatherless; They take the widow's ox for a pledge."
18,24,4,"They turn the needy out of the way: The poor of the earth all hide themselves."
18,24,5,"Behold, as wild asses in the desert They go forth to their work, seeking diligently for food; The wilderness `yieldeth' them bread for their children."
18,24,6,"They cut their provender in the field; And they glean the vintage of the wicked."
18,24,7,"They lie all night naked without clothing, And have no covering in the cold."
18,24,8,"They are wet with the showers of the mountains, And embrace the rock for want of a shelter."
18,24,9,"There are that pluck the fatherless from the breast, And take a pledge of the poor;"
18,24,10,"`So that' they go about naked without clothing, And being hungry they carry the sheaves."
18,24,11,"They make oil within the walls of these men; They tread `their' winepresses, and suffer thirst."
18,24,12,"From out of the populous city men groan, And the soul of the wounded crieth out: Yet God regardeth not the folly."
18,24,13,"These are of them that rebel against the light; They know not the ways thereof, Nor abide in the paths thereof."
18,24,14,"The murderer riseth with the light; He killeth the poor and needy; And in the night he is as a thief."
18,24,15,"The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, Saying, No eye shall see me: And he disguiseth his face."
18,24,16,"In the dark they dig through houses: They shut themselves up in the day-time; They know not the light."
18,24,17,"For the morning is to all of them as thick darkness; For they know the terrors of the thick darkness."
18,24,18,"Swiftly they `pass away' upon the face of the waters; Their portion is cursed in the earth: They turn not into the way of the vineyards."
18,24,19,"Drought and heat consume the snow waters: `So doth' Sheol `those that' have sinned."
18,24,20,"The womb shall forget him; The worm shall feed sweetly on him; He shall be no more remembered; And unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree."
18,24,21,"He devoureth the barren that beareth not, And doeth not good to the widow."
18,24,22,"Yet `God' preserveth the mighty by his power: He riseth up that hath no assurance of life."
18,24,23,"`God' giveth them to be in security, and they rest thereon; And his eyes are upon their ways."
18,24,24,"They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone; Yea, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as all others, And are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain."
18,24,25,"And if it be not so now, who will prove me a liar, And make my speech nothing worth?"
18,25,1,"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,"
18,25,2,"Dominion and fear are with him; He maketh peace in his high places."
18,25,3,"Is there any number of his armies? And upon whom doth not his light arise?"
18,25,4,"How then can man be just with God? Or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?"
18,25,5,"Behold, even the moon hath no brightness, And the stars are not pure in his sight:"
18,25,6,"How much less man, that is a worm! And the son of man, that is a worm!"
18,26,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
18,26,2,"How hast thou helped him that is without power! How hast thou saved the arm that hath no strength!"
18,26,3,"How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom, And plentifully declared sound knowledge!"
18,26,4,"To whom hast thou uttered words? And whose spirit came forth from thee?"
18,26,5,"They that are deceased tremble Beneath the waters and the inhabitants thereof."
18,26,6,"Sheol is naked before `God', And Abaddon hath no covering."
18,26,7,"He stretcheth out the north over empty space, And hangeth the earth upon nothing."
18,26,8,"He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; And the cloud is not rent under them."
18,26,9,"He incloseth the face of his throne, And spreadeth his cloud upon it."
18,26,10,"He hath described a boundary upon the face of the waters, Unto the confines of light and darkness."
18,26,11,"The pillars of heaven tremble And are astonished at his rebuke."
18,26,12,"He stirreth up the sea with his power, And by his understanding he smiteth through Rahab."
18,26,13,"By his Spirit the heavens are garnished; His hand hath pierced the swift serpent."
18,26,14,"Lo, these are but the outskirts of his ways: And how small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?"
18,27,1,"And Job again took up his parable, and said,"
18,27,2,"As God liveth, who hath taken away my right, And the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul:"
18,27,3,"(For my life is yet whole in me, And the spirit of God is in my nostrils);"
18,27,4,"Surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness, Neither shall my tongue utter deceit."
18,27,5,"Far be it from me that I should justify you: Till I die I will not put away mine integrity from me."
18,27,6,"My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: My heart shall not reproach `me' so long as I live."
18,27,7,"Let mine enemy be as the wicked, And let him that riseth up against me be as the unrighteous."
18,27,8,"For what is the hope of the godless, though he get him gain, When God taketh away his soul?"
18,27,9,"Will God hear his cry, When trouble cometh upon him?"
18,27,10,"Will he delight himself in the Almighty, And call upon God at all times?"
18,27,11,"I will teach you concerning the hand of God; That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal."
18,27,12,"Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; Why then are ye become altogether vain?"
18,27,13,"This is the portion of a wicked man with God, And the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty:"
18,27,14,"If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword; And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread."
18,27,15,"Those that remain of him shall be buried in death, And his widows shall make no lamentation."
18,27,16,"Though he heap up silver as the dust, And prepare raiment as the clay;"
18,27,17,"He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, And the innocent shall divide the silver."
18,27,18,"He buildeth his house as the moth, And as a booth which the keeper maketh."
18,27,19,"He lieth down rich, but he shall not be gathered `to his fathers'; He openeth his eyes, and he is not."
18,27,20,"Terrors overtake him like waters; A tempest stealeth him away in the night."
18,27,21,"The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth; And it sweepeth him out of his place."
18,27,22,"For `God' shall hurl at him, and not spare: He would fain flee out of his hand."
18,27,23,"Men shall clap their hands at him, And shall hiss him out of his place."
18,28,1,"Surely there is a mine for silver, And a place for gold which they refine."
18,28,2,"Iron is taken out of the earth, And copper is molten out of the stone."
18,28,3,"`Man' setteth an end to darkness, And searcheth out, to the furthest bound, The stones of obscurity and of thick darkness."
18,28,4,"He breaketh open a shaft away from where men sojourn; They are forgotten of the foot; They hang afar from men, they swing to and fro."
18,28,5,"As for the earth, out of it cometh bread; And underneath it is turned up as it were by fire."
18,28,6,"The stones thereof are the place of sapphires, And it hath dust of gold."
18,28,7,"That path no bird of prey knoweth, Neither hath the falcon's eye seen it:"
18,28,8,"The proud beasts have not trodden it, Nor hath the fierce lion passed thereby."
18,28,9,"He putteth forth his hand upon the flinty rock; He overturneth the mountains by the roots."
18,28,10,"He cutteth out channels among the rocks; And his eye seeth every precious thing."
18,28,11,"He bindeth the streams that they trickle not; And the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light."
18,28,12,"But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?"
18,28,13,"Man knoweth not the price thereof; Neither is it found in the land of the living."
18,28,14,"The deep saith, It is not in me; And the sea saith, It is not with me."
18,28,15,"It cannot be gotten for gold, Neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof."
18,28,16,"It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, With the precious onyx, or the sapphire."
18,28,17,"Gold and glass cannot equal it, Neither shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold."
18,28,18,"No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal: Yea, the price of wisdom is above rubies."
18,28,19,"The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, Neither shall it be valued with pure gold."
18,28,20,"Whence then cometh wisdom? And where is the place of understanding?"
18,28,21,"Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, And kept close from the birds of the heavens."
18,28,22,"Destruction and Death say, We have heard a rumor thereof with our ears."
18,28,23,"God understandeth the way thereof, And he knoweth the place thereof."
18,28,24,"For he looketh to the ends of the earth, And seeth under the whole heaven;"
18,28,25,"To make a weight for the wind: Yea, he meteth out the waters by measure."
18,28,26,"When he made a decree for the rain, And a way for the lightning of the thunder;"
18,28,27,"Then did he see it, and declare it; He established it, yea, and searched it out."
18,28,28,"And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; And to depart from evil is understanding."
18,29,1,"And Job again took up his parable, and said,"
18,29,2,"Oh that I were as in the months of old, As in the days when God watched over me;"
18,29,3,"When his lamp shined upon my head, And by his light I walked through darkness;"
18,29,4,"As I was in the ripeness of my days, When the friendship of God was upon my tent;"
18,29,5,"When the Almighty was yet with me, And my children were about me;"
18,29,6,"When my steps were washed with butter, And the rock poured me out streams of oil!"
18,29,7,"When I went forth to the gate unto the city, When I prepared my seat in the street,"
18,29,8,"The young men saw me and hid themselves, And the aged rose up and stood;"
18,29,9,"The princes refrained from talking, And laid their hand on their mouth;"
18,29,10,"The voice of the nobles was hushed, And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth."
18,29,11,"For when the ear heard `me', then it blessed me; And when the eye saw `me', it gave witness unto me:"
18,29,12,"Because I delivered the poor that cried, The fatherless also, that had none to help him."
18,29,13,"The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me; And I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy."
18,29,14,"I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: My justice was as a robe and a diadem."
18,29,15,"I was eyes to the blind, And feet was I to the lame."
18,29,16,"I was a father to the needy: And the cause of him that I knew not I searched out."
18,29,17,"And I brake the jaws of the unrighteous, And plucked the prey out of his teeth."
18,29,18,"Then I said, I shall die in my nest, And I shall multiply my days as the sand:"
18,29,19,"My root is spread out to the waters, And the dew lieth all night upon my branch;"
18,29,20,"My glory is fresh in me, And my bow is renewed in my hand."
18,29,21,"Unto me men gave ear, and waited, And kept silence for my counsel."
18,29,22,"After my words they spake not again; And my speech distilled upon them."
18,29,23,"And they waited for me as for the rain; And they opened their mouth wide `as' for the latter rain."
18,29,24,"I smiled on them, when they had no confidence; And the light of my countenance they cast not down."
18,29,25,"I chose out their way, and sat `as' chief, And dwelt as a king in the army, As one that comforteth the mourners."
18,30,1,"But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, Whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my flock."
18,30,2,"Yea, the strength of their hands, whereto should it profit me? Men in whom ripe age is perished."
18,30,3,"They are gaunt with want and famine; They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of wasteness and desolation."
18,30,4,"They pluck salt-wort by the bushes; And the roots of the broom are their food."
18,30,5,"They are driven forth from the midst `of men'; They cry after them as after a thief;"
18,30,6,"So that they dwell in frightful valleys, In holes of the earth and of the rocks."
18,30,7,"Among the bushes they bray; Under the nettles they are gathered together."
18,30,8,"`They are' children of fools, yea, children of base men; They were scourged out of the land."
18,30,9,"And now I am become their song, Yea, I am a byword unto them."
18,30,10,"They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, And spare not to spit in my face."
18,30,11,"For he hath loosed his cord, and afflicted me; And they have cast off the bridle before me."
18,30,12,"Upon my right hand rise the rabble; They thrust aside my feet, And they cast up against me their ways of destruction."
18,30,13,"They mar my path, They set forward my calamity, `Even' men that have no helper."
18,30,14,"As through a wide breach they come: In the midst of the ruin they roll themselves `upon me'."
18,30,15,"Terrors are turned upon me; They chase mine honor as the wind; And my welfare is passed away as a cloud."
18,30,16,"And now my soul is poured out within me; Days of affliction have taken hold upon me."
18,30,17,"In the night season my bones are pierced in me, And the `pains' that gnaw me take no rest."
18,30,18,"By `God's' great force is my garment disfigured; It bindeth me about as the collar of my coat."
18,30,19,"He hath cast me into the mire, And I am become like dust and ashes."
18,30,20,"I cry unto thee, and thou dost not answer me: I stand up, and thou gazest at me."
18,30,21,"Thou art turned to be cruel to me; With the might of thy hand thou persecutest me."
18,30,22,"Thou liftest me up to the wind, thou causest me to ride `upon it'; And thou dissolvest me in the storm."
18,30,23,"For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, And to the house appointed for all living."
18,30,24,"Howbeit doth not one stretch out the hand in his fall? Or in his calamity therefore cry for help?"
18,30,25,"Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? Was not my soul grieved for the needy?"
18,30,26,"When I looked for good, then evil came; And when I waited for light, there came darkness."
18,30,27,"My heart is troubled, and resteth not; Days of affliction are come upon me."
18,30,28,"I go mourning without the sun: I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help."
18,30,29,"I am a brother to jackals, And a companion to ostriches."
18,30,30,"My skin is black, `and falleth' from me, And my bones are burned with heat."
18,30,31,"Therefore is my harp `turned' to mourning, And my pipe into the voice of them that weep."
18,31,1,"I made a covenant with mine eyes; How then should I look upon a virgin?"
18,31,2,"For what is the portion from God above, And the heritage from the Almighty on high?"
18,31,3,"Is it not calamity to the unrighteous, And disaster to the workers of iniquity?"
18,31,4,"Doth not he see my ways, And number all my steps?"
18,31,5,"If I have walked with falsehood, And my foot hath hasted to deceit;"
18,31,6,"(Let me be weighed in an even balance, That God may know mine integrity);"
18,31,7,"If my step hath turned out of the way, And my heart walked after mine eyes, And if any spot hath cleaved to my hands:"
18,31,8,"Then let me sow, and let another eat; Yea, let the produce of my field be rooted out."
18,31,9,"If my heart hath been enticed unto a woman, And I have laid wait at my neighbor's door;"
18,31,10,"Then let my wife grind unto another, And let others bow down upon her."
18,31,11,"For that were a heinous crime; Yea, it were an iniquity to be punished by the judges:"
18,31,12,"For it is a fire that consumeth unto Destruction, And would root out all mine increase."
18,31,13,"If I have despised the cause of my man-servant or of my maid-servant, When they contended with me;"
18,31,14,"What then shall I do when God riseth up? And when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?"
18,31,15,"Did not he that made me in the womb make him? And did not one fashion us in the womb?"
18,31,16,"If I have withheld the poor from `their' desire, Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,"
18,31,17,"Or have eaten my morsel alone, And the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;"
18,31,18,"(Nay, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, And her have I guided from my mother's womb);"
18,31,19,"If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, Or that the needy had no covering;"
18,31,20,"If his loins have not blessed me, And if he hath not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep;"
18,31,21,"If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, Because I saw my help in the gate:"
18,31,22,"Then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder-blade, And mine arm be broken from the bone."
18,31,23,"For calamity from God is a terror to me, And by reason of his majesty I can do nothing."
18,31,24,"If I have made gold my hope, And have said to the fine gold, `Thou art' my confidence;"
18,31,25,"If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, And because my hand had gotten much;"
18,31,26,"If I have beheld the sun when it shined, Or the moon walking in brightness,"
18,31,27,"And my heart hath been secretly enticed, And my mouth hath kissed my hand:"
18,31,28,"This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judges; For I should have denied the God that is above."
18,31,29,"If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, Or lifted up myself when evil found him;"
18,31,30,"(Yea, I have not suffered by mouth to sin By asking his life with a curse);"
18,31,31,"If the men of my tent have not said, Who can find one that hath not been filled with his meat?"
18,31,32,"(The sojourner hath not lodged in the street; But I have opened my doors to the traveller);"
18,31,33,"If like Adam I have covered my transgressions, By hiding mine iniquity in my bosom,"
18,31,34,"Because I feared the great multitude, And the contempt of families terrified me, So that I kept silence, and went not out of the door-"
18,31,35,"Oh that I had one to hear me! (Lo, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me); And `that I had' the indictment which mine adversary hath written!"
18,31,36,"Surely I would carry it upon my shoulder; I would bind it unto me as a crown:"
18,31,37,"I would declare unto him the number of my steps; As a prince would I go near unto him."
18,31,38,"If my land crieth out against me, And the furrows thereof weep together;"
18,31,39,"If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, Or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:"
18,31,40,"Let thistles grow instead of wheat, And cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended."
18,32,1,"So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes."
18,32,2,"Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God."
18,32,3,"Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job."
18,32,4,"Now Elihu had waited to speak unto Job, because they were elder than he."
18,32,5,"And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled."
18,32,6,"And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; Wherefore I held back, and durst not show you mine opinion."
18,32,7,"I said, Days should speak, And multitude of years should teach wisdom."
18,32,8,"But there is a spirit in man, And the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding."
18,32,9,"It is not the great that are wise, Nor the aged that understand justice."
18,32,10,"Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will show mine opinion."
18,32,11,"Behold, I waited for your words, I listened for your reasonings, Whilst ye searched out what to say."
18,32,12,"Yea, I attended unto you, And, behold, there was none that convinced Job, Or that answered his words, among you."
18,32,13,"Beware lest ye say, We have found wisdom; God may vanquish him, not man:"
18,32,14,"For he hath not directed his words against me; Neither will I answer him with your speeches."
18,32,15,"They are amazed, they answer no more: They have not a word to say."
18,32,16,"And shall I wait, because they speak not, Because they stand still, and answer no more?"
18,32,17,"I also will answer my part, I also will show mine opinion."
18,32,18,"For I am full of words; The spirit within me constraineth me."
18,32,19,"Behold, my breast is as wine which hath no vent; Like new wine-skins it is ready to burst."
18,32,20,"I will speak, that I may be refreshed; I will open my lips and answer."
18,32,21,"Let me not, I pray you, respect any man's person; Neither will I give flattering titles unto any man."
18,32,22,"For I know not to give flattering titles; `Else' would my Maker soon take me away."
18,33,1,"Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear my speech, And hearken to all my words."
18,33,2,"Behold now, I have opened my mouth; My tongue hath spoken in my mouth."
18,33,3,"My words `shall utter' the uprightness of my heart; And that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely."
18,33,4,"The Spirit of God hath made me, And the breath of the Almighty giveth me life."
18,33,5,"If thou canst, answer thou me; Set `thy words' in order before me, stand forth."
18,33,6,"Behold, I am toward God even as thou art: I also am formed out of the clay."
18,33,7,"Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, Neither shall my pressure be heavy upon thee."
18,33,8,"Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, And I have heard the voice of `thy' words, `saying',"
18,33,9,"I am clean, without transgression; I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me:"
18,33,10,"Behold, he findeth occasions against me, He counteth me for his enemy:"
18,33,11,"He putteth my feet in the stocks, He marketh all my paths."
18,33,12,"Behold, I will answer thee, in this thou art not just; For God is greater than man."
18,33,13,"Why dost thou strive against him, For that he giveth not account of any of his matters?"
18,33,14,"For God speaketh once, Yea twice, `though man' regardeth it not."
18,33,15,"In a dream, in a vision of the night, When deep sleep falleth upon men, In slumberings upon the bed;"
18,33,16,"Then he openeth the ears of men, And sealeth their instruction,"
18,33,17,"That he may withdraw man `from his' purpose, And hide pride from man;"
18,33,18,"He keepeth back his soul from the pit, And his life from perishing by the sword."
18,33,19,"He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, And with continual strife in his bones;"
18,33,20,"So that his life abhorreth bread, And his soul dainty food."
18,33,21,"His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; And his bones that were not seen stick out."
18,33,22,"Yea, his soul draweth near unto the pit, And his life to the destroyers."
18,33,23,"If there be with him an angel, An interpreter, one among a thousand, To show unto man what is right for him;"
18,33,24,"Then `God' is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom."
18,33,25,"His flesh shall be fresher than a child's; He returneth to the days of his youth."
18,33,26,"He prayeth unto God, and he is favorable unto him, So that he seeth his face with joy: And he restoreth unto man his righteousness."
18,33,27,"He singeth before men, and saith, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, And it profited me not:"
18,33,28,"He hath redeemed my soul from going into the pit, And my life shall behold the light."
18,33,29,"Lo, all these things doth God work, Twice, `yea' thrice, with a man,"
18,33,30,"To bring back his soul from the pit, That he may be enlightened with the light of the living."
18,33,31,"Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: Hold thy peace, and I will speak."
18,33,32,"If thou hast anything to say, answer me: Speak, for I desire to justify thee."
18,33,33,"If not, hearken thou unto me: Hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom."
18,34,1,"Moreover Elihu answered and said,"
18,34,2,"Hear my words, ye wise men; And give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge."
18,34,3,"For the ear trieth words, As the palate tasteth food."
18,34,4,"Let us choose for us that which is right: Let us know among ourselves what is good."
18,34,5,"For Job hath said, I am righteous, And God hath taken away my right:"
18,34,6,"Notwithstanding my right I am `accounted' a liar; My wound is incurable, `though I am' without transgression."
18,34,7,"What man is like Job, Who drinketh up scoffing like water,"
18,34,8,"Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, And walketh with wicked men?"
18,34,9,"For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing That he should delight himself with God."
18,34,10,"Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness, And from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity."
18,34,11,"For the work of a man will he render unto him, And cause every man to find according to his ways."
18,34,12,"Yea, of a surety, God will not do wickedly, Neither will the Almighty pervert justice."
18,34,13,"Who gave him a charge over the earth? Or who hath disposed the whole world?"
18,34,14,"If he set his heart upon himself, `If' he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;"
18,34,15,"All flesh shall perish together, And man shall turn again unto dust."
18,34,16,"If now `thou hast' understanding, hear this: Hearken to the voice of my words."
18,34,17,"Shall even one that hateth justice govern? And wilt thou condemn him that is righteous `and' mighty?-"
18,34,18,"`Him' that saith to a king, `Thou art' vile, `Or' to nobles, `Ye are' wicked;"
18,34,19,"That respecteth not the persons of princes, Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor; For they all are the work of his hands."
18,34,20,"In a moment they die, even at midnight; The people are shaken and pass away, And the mighty are taken away without hand."
18,34,21,"For his eyes are upon the ways of a man, And he seeth all his goings."
18,34,22,"There is no darkness, nor thick gloom, Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves."
18,34,23,"For he needeth not further to consider a man, That he should go before God in judgment."
18,34,24,"He breaketh in pieces mighty men `in ways' past finding out, And setteth others in their stead."
18,34,25,"Therefore he taketh knowledge of their works; And he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed."
18,34,26,"He striketh them as wicked men In the open sight of others;"
18,34,27,"Because they turned aside from following him, And would not have regard in any of his ways:"
18,34,28,"So that they caused the cry of the poor to come unto him, And he heard the cry of the afflicted."
18,34,29,"When he giveth quietness, who then can condemn? And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? Alike whether `it be done' unto a nation, or unto a man:"
18,34,30,"That the godless man reign not, That there be none to ensnare the people."
18,34,31,"For hath any said unto God, I have borne `chastisement', I will not offend `any more':"
18,34,32,"That which I see not teach thou me: If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more?"
18,34,33,"Shall his recompense be as thou wilt, that thou refusest it? For thou must choose, and not I: Therefore speak what thou knowest."
18,34,34,"Men of understanding will say unto me, Yea, every wise man that heareth me:"
18,34,35,"Job speaketh without knowledge, And his words are without wisdom."
18,34,36,"Would that Job were tried unto the end, Because of his answering like wicked men."
18,34,37,"For he addeth rebellion unto his sin; He clappeth his hands among us, And multiplieth his words against God."
18,35,1,"Moreover Elihu answered and said,"
18,35,2,"Thinkest thou this to be `thy' right, `Or' sayest thou, My righteousness is more than God's,"
18,35,3,"That thou sayest, What advantage will it be unto thee? `And', What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?"
18,35,4,"I will answer thee, And thy companions with thee."
18,35,5,"Look unto the heavens, and see; And behold the skies, which are higher than thou."
18,35,6,"If thou hast sinned, what effectest thou against him? And if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?"
18,35,7,"If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? Or what receiveth he of thy hand?"
18,35,8,"Thy wickedness `may hurt' a man as thou art; And thy righteousness `may profit' a son of man."
18,35,9,"By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty."
18,35,10,"But none saith, Where is God my Maker, Who giveth songs in the night,"
18,35,11,"Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, And maketh us wiser than the birds of the heavens?"
18,35,12,"There they cry, but none giveth answer, Because of the pride of evil men."
18,35,13,"Surely God will not hear an empty `cry', Neither will the Almighty regard it."
18,35,14,"How much less when thou sayest thou beholdest him not, The cause is before him, and thou waitest for him!"
18,35,15,"But now, because he hath not visited in his anger, Neither doth he greatly regard arrogance;"
18,35,16,"Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vanity; He multiplieth words without knowledge."
18,36,1,"Elihu also proceeded, and said,"
18,36,2,"Suffer me a little, and I will show thee; For I have yet somewhat to say on God's behalf."
18,36,3,"I will fetch my knowledge from afar, And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker."
18,36,4,"For truly my words are not false: One that is perfect in knowledge is with thee."
18,36,5,"Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: He is mighty in strength of understanding."
18,36,6,"He preserveth not the life of the wicked, But giveth to the afflicted `their' right."
18,36,7,"He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: But with kings upon the throne He setteth them for ever, and they are exalted."
18,36,8,"And if they be bound in fetters, And be taken in the cords of afflictions;"
18,36,9,"Then he showeth them their work, And their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly."
18,36,10,"He openeth also their ear to instruction, And commandeth that they return from iniquity."
18,36,11,"If they hearken and serve `him', They shall spend their days in prosperity, And their years in pleasures."
18,36,12,"But if they hearken not, they shall perish by the sword, And they shall die without knowledge."
18,36,13,"But they that are godless in heart lay up anger: They cry not for help when he bindeth them."
18,36,14,"They die in youth, And their life `perisheth' among the unclean."
18,36,15,"He delivereth the afflicted by their affliction, And openeth their ear in oppression."
18,36,16,"Yea, he would have allured thee out of distress Into a broad place, where there is no straitness; And that which is set on thy table would be full of fatness."
18,36,17,"But thou art full of the judgment of the wicked: Judgment and justice take hold `on thee'."
18,36,18,"For let not wrath stir thee up against chastisements; Neither let the greatness of the ransom turn thee aside."
18,36,19,"Will thy cry avail, `that thou be' not in distress, Or all the forces of `thy' strength?"
18,36,20,"Desire not the night, When peoples are cut off in their place."
18,36,21,"Take heed, regard not iniquity: For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction."
18,36,22,"Behold, God doeth loftily in his power: Who is a teacher like unto him?"
18,36,23,"Who hath enjoined him his way? Or who can say, Thou hast wrought unrighteousness?"
18,36,24,"Remember that thou magnify his work, Whereof men have sung."
18,36,25,"All men have looked thereon; Man beholdeth it afar off."
18,36,26,"Behold, God is great, and we know him not; The number of his years is unsearchable."
18,36,27,"For he draweth up the drops of water, Which distil in rain from his vapor,"
18,36,28,"Which the skies pour down And drop upon man abundantly."
18,36,29,"Yea, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, The thunderings of his pavilion?"
18,36,30,"Behold, he spreadeth his light around him; And he covereth the bottom of the sea."
18,36,31,"For by these he judgeth the peoples; He giveth food in abundance."
18,36,32,"He covereth his hands with the lightning, And giveth it a charge that it strike the mark."
18,36,33,"The noise thereof telleth concerning him, The cattle also concerning `the storm' that cometh up."
18,37,1,"Yea, at this my heart trembleth, And is moved out of its place."
18,37,2,"Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice, And the sound that goeth out of his mouth."
18,37,3,"He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven, And his lightening unto the ends of the earth."
18,37,4,"After it a voice roareth; He thundereth with the voice of his majesty; And he restraineth not `the lightnings' when his voice is heard."
18,37,5,"God thundereth marvellously with his voice; Great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend."
18,37,6,"For he saith to the snow, Fall thou on the earth; Likewise to the shower of rain, And to the showers of his mighty rain."
18,37,7,"He sealeth up the hand of every man, That all men whom he hath made may know `it'."
18,37,8,"Then the beasts go into coverts, And remain in their dens."
18,37,9,"Out of the chamber `of the south' cometh the storm, And cold out of the north."
18,37,10,"By the breath of God ice is given; And the breadth of the waters is straitened."
18,37,11,"Yea, he ladeth the thick cloud with moisture; He spreadeth abroad the cloud of his lightning:"
18,37,12,"And it is turned round about by his guidance, That they may do whatsoever he commandeth them Upon the face of the habitable world,"
18,37,13,"Whether it be for correction, or for his land, Or for lovingkindness, that he cause it to come."
18,37,14,"Hearken unto this, O Job: Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God."
18,37,15,"Dost thou know how God layeth `his charge' upon them, And causeth the lightning of his cloud to shine?"
18,37,16,"Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, The wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?"
18,37,17,"How thy garments are warm, When the earth is still by reason of the south `wind'?"
18,37,18,"Canst thou with him spread out the sky, Which is strong as a molten mirror?"
18,37,19,"Teach us what we shall say unto him; `For' we cannot set `our speech' in order by reason of darkness."
18,37,20,"Shall it be told him that I would speak? Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?"
18,37,21,"And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies; But the wind passeth, and cleareth them."
18,37,22,"Out of the north cometh golden splendor: God hath upon him terrible majesty."
18,37,23,"`Touching' the Almighty, we cannot find him out He is excellent in power; And in justice and plenteous righteousness he will not afflict."
18,37,24,"Men do therefore fear him: He regardeth not any that are wise of heart."
18,38,1,"Then Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,"
18,38,2,"Who is this that darkeneth counsel By words without knowledge?"
18,38,3,"Gird up now thy loins like a man; For I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me."
18,38,4,"Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding."
18,38,5,"Who determined the measures thereof, if thou knowest? Or who stretched the line upon it?"
18,38,6,"Whereupon were the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid the corner-stone thereof,"
18,38,7,"When the morning stars sang together, And all the sons of God shouted for joy?"
18,38,8,"Or `who' shut up the sea with doors, When it brake forth, `as if' it had issued out of the womb;"
18,38,9,"When I made clouds the garment thereof, And thick darkness a swaddling-band for it,"
18,38,10,"And marked out for it my bound, And set bars and doors,"
18,38,11,"And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further; And here shall thy proud waves be stayed?"
18,38,12,"Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days `began', `And' caused the dayspring to know its place;"
18,38,13,"That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, And the wicked be shaken out of it?"
18,38,14,"It is changed as clay under the seal; And `all things' stand forth as a garment:"
18,38,15,"And from the wicked their light is withholden, And the high arm is broken."
18,38,16,"Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? Or hast thou walked in the recesses of the deep?"
18,38,17,"Have the gates of death been revealed unto thee? Or hast thou seen the gates of the shadow of death?"
18,38,18,"Hast thou comprehended the earth in its breadth? Declare, if thou knowest it all."
18,38,19,"Where is the way to the dwelling of light? And as for darkness, where is the place thereof,"
18,38,20,"That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, And that thou shouldest discern the paths to the house thereof?"
18,38,21,"`Doubtless', thou knowest, for thou wast then born, And the number of thy days is great!"
18,38,22,"Hast thou entered the treasuries of the snow, Or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,"
18,38,23,"Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, Against the day of battle and war?"
18,38,24,"By what way is the light parted, Or the east wind scattered upon the earth?"
18,38,25,"Who hath cleft a channel for the waterflood, Or the way for the lightning of the thunder;"
18,38,26,"To cause it to rain on a land where no man is; On the wilderness, wherein there is no man;"
18,38,27,"To satisfy the waste and desolate `ground', And to cause the tender grass to spring forth?"
18,38,28,"Hath the rain a father? Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?"
18,38,29,"Out of whose womb came the ice? And the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?"
18,38,30,"The waters hide themselves `and become' like stone, And the face of the deep is frozen."
18,38,31,"Canst thou bind the cluster of the Pleiades, Or loose the bands of Orion?"
18,38,32,"Canst thou lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season? Or canst thou guide the Bear with her train?"
18,38,33,"Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens? Canst thou establish the dominion thereof in the earth?"
18,38,34,"Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, That abundance of waters may cover thee?"
18,38,35,"Canst thou send forth lightnings, that they may go, And say unto thee, Here we are?"
18,38,36,"Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? Or who hath given understanding to the mind?"
18,38,37,"Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can pour out the bottles of heaven,"
18,38,38,"When the dust runneth into a mass, And the clods cleave fast together?"
18,38,39,"Canst thou hunt the prey for the lioness, Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,"
18,38,40,"When they couch in their dens, `And' abide in the covert to lie in wait?"
18,38,41,"Who provideth for the raven his prey, When his young ones cry unto God, `And' wander for lack of food?"
18,39,1,"Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? `Or' canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?"
18,39,2,"Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?"
18,39,3,"They bow themselves, they bring forth their young, They cast out their pains."
18,39,4,"Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open field; They go forth, and return not again."
18,39,5,"Who hath sent out the wild ass free? Or who hath loosed the bonds of the swift ass,"
18,39,6,"Whose home I have made the wilderness, And the salt land his dwelling-place?"
18,39,7,"He scorneth the tumult of the city, Neither heareth he the shoutings of the driver."
18,39,8,"The range of the mountains is his pasture, And he searcheth after every green thing."
18,39,9,"Will the wild-ox be content to serve thee? Or will he abide by thy crib?"
18,39,10,"Canst thou bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow? Or will he harrow the valleys after thee?"
18,39,11,"Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? Or wilt thou leave to him thy labor?"
18,39,12,"Wilt thou confide in him, that he will bring home thy seed, And gather `the grain' of thy threshing-floor?"
18,39,13,"The wings of the ostrich wave proudly; `But' are they the pinions and plumage of love?"
18,39,14,"For she leaveth her eggs on the earth, And warmeth them in the dust,"
18,39,15,"And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, Or that the wild beast may trample them."
18,39,16,"She dealeth hardly with her young ones, as if they were not hers: Though her labor be in vain, `she is' without fear;"
18,39,17,"Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, Neither hath he imparted to her understanding."
18,39,18,"What time she lifteth up herself on high, She scorneth the horse and his rider."
18,39,19,"Hast thou given the horse `his' might? Hast thou clothed his neck with the quivering mane?"
18,39,20,"Hast thou made him to leap as a locust? The glory of his snorting is terrible."
18,39,21,"He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: He goeth out to meet the armed men."
18,39,22,"He mocketh at fear, and is not dismayed; Neither turneth he back from the sword."
18,39,23,"The quiver rattleth against him, The flashing spear and the javelin."
18,39,24,"He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage; Neither believeth he that it is the voice of the trumpet."
18,39,25,"As oft as the trumpet `soundeth' he saith, Aha! And he smelleth the battle afar off, The thunder of the captains, and the shouting."
18,39,26,"Is it by thy wisdom that the hawk soareth, (And) stretcheth her wings toward the south?"
18,39,27,"Is it at thy command that the eagle mounteth up, And maketh her nest on high?"
18,39,28,"On the cliff she dwelleth, and maketh her home, Upon the point of the cliff, and the stronghold."
18,39,29,"From thence she spieth out the prey; Her eyes behold it afar off."
18,39,30,"Her young ones also suck up blood: And where the slain are, there is she."
18,40,1,"Moreover Jehovah answered Job, and said,"
18,40,2,"Shall he that cavilleth contend with the Almighty? He that argueth with God, let him answer it."
18,40,3,"Then Job answered Jehovah, and said,"
18,40,4,"Behold, I am of small account; What shall I answer thee? I lay my hand upon my mouth."
18,40,5,"Once have I spoken, and I will not answer; Yea, twice, but I will proceed no further."
18,40,6,"Then Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,"
18,40,7,"Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me."
18,40,8,"Wilt thou even annul my judgment? Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be justified?"
18,40,9,"Or hast thou an arm like God? And canst thou thunder with a voice like him?"
18,40,10,"Deck thyself now with excellency and dignity; And array thyself with honor and majesty."
18,40,11,"Pour forth the overflowings of thine anger; And look upon every one that is proud, and abase him."
18,40,12,"Look on every one that is proud, `and' bring him low; And tread down the wicked where they stand."
18,40,13,"Hide them in the dust together; Bind their faces in the hidden `place'."
18,40,14,"Then will I also confess of thee That thine own right hand can save thee."
18,40,15,"Behold now, behemoth, which I made as well as thee; He eateth grass as an ox."
18,40,16,"Lo now, his strength is in his loins, And his force is in the muscles of his belly."
18,40,17,"He moveth his tail like a cedar: The sinews of his thighs are knit together."
18,40,18,"His bones are `as' tubes of brass; His limbs are like bars of iron."
18,40,19,"He is the chief of the ways of God: He `only' that made him giveth him his sword."
18,40,20,"Surely the mountains bring him forth food, Where all the beasts of the field do play."
18,40,21,"He lieth under the lotus-trees, In the covert of the reed, and the fen."
18,40,22,"The lotus-trees cover him with their shade; The willows of the brook compass him about."
18,40,23,"Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not; He is confident, though a Jordan swell even to his mouth."
18,40,24,"Shall any take him when he is on the watch, Or pierce through his nose with a snare?"
18,41,1,"Canst thou draw out leviathan with a fishhook? Or press down his tongue with a cord?"
18,41,2,"Canst thou put a rope into his nose? Or pierce his jaw through with a hook?"
18,41,3,"Will he make many supplications unto thee? Or will he speak soft words unto thee?"
18,41,4,"Will he make a covenant with thee, That thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever?"
18,41,5,"Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?"
18,41,6,"Will the bands `of fishermen' make traffic of him? Will they part him among the merchants?"
18,41,7,"Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons, Or his head with fish-spears?"
18,41,8,"Lay thy hand upon him; Remember the battle, and do so no more."
18,41,9,"Behold, the hope of him is in vain: Will not one be cast down even at the sight of him?"
18,41,10,"None is so fierce that he dare stir him up; Who then is he that can stand before me?"
18,41,11,"Who hath first given unto me, that I should repay him? `Whatsoever is' under the whole heaven is mine."
18,41,12,"I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, Nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame."
18,41,13,"Who can strip off his outer garment? Who shall come within his jaws?"
18,41,14,"Who can open the doors of his face? Round about his teeth is terror."
18,41,15,"`His' strong scales are `his' pride, Shut up together `as with' a close seal."
18,41,16,"One is so near to another, That no air can come between them."
18,41,17,"They are joined one to another; They stick together, so that they cannot be sundered."
18,41,18,"His sneezings flash forth light, And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning."
18,41,19,"Out of his mouth go burning torches, And sparks of fire leap forth."
18,41,20,"Out of his nostrils a smoke goeth, As of a boiling pot and `burning' rushes."
18,41,21,"His breath kindleth coals, And a flame goeth forth from his mouth."
18,41,22,"In his neck abideth strength, And terror danceth before him."
18,41,23,"The flakes of his flesh are joined together: They are firm upon him; they cannot be moved."
18,41,24,"His heart is as firm as a stone; Yea, firm as the nether millstone."
18,41,25,"When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid: By reason of consternation they are beside themselves."
18,41,26,"If one lay at him with the sword, it cannot avail; Nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft."
18,41,27,"He counteth iron as straw, `And' brass as rotten wood."
18,41,28,"The arrow cannot make him flee: Sling-stones are turned with him into stubble."
18,41,29,"Clubs are counted as stubble: He laugheth at the rushing of the javelin."
18,41,30,"His underparts are `like' sharp potsherds: He spreadeth `as it were' a threshing-wain upon the mire."
18,41,31,"He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: He maketh the sea like a pot of ointment."
18,41,32,"He maketh a path to shine after him; One would think the deep to be hoary."
18,41,33,"Upon earth there is not his like, That is made without fear."
18,41,34,"He beholdeth everything that is high: He is king over all the sons of pride."
18,42,1,"Then Job answered Jehovah, and said,"
18,42,2,"I know that thou canst do all things, And that no purpose of thine can be restrained."
18,42,3,"Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore have I uttered that which I understood not, Things too wonderful for me, which I knew not."
18,42,4,"Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak; I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me."
18,42,5,"I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear; But now mine eye seeth thee:"
18,42,6,"Wherefore I abhor `myself', And repent in dust and ashes."
18,42,7,"And it was so, that, after Jehovah had spoken these words unto Job, Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends; for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath."
18,42,8,"Now therefore, take unto you seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt-offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you; for him will I accept, that I deal not with you after your folly; for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath."
18,42,9,"So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as Jehovah commanded them: and Jehovah accepted Job."
18,42,10,"And Jehovah turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: and Jehovah gave Job twice as much as he had before."
18,42,11,"Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him concerning all the evil that Jehovah had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one a ring of gold."
18,42,12,"So Jehovah blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: And he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses."
18,42,13,"He had also seven sons and three daughters."
18,42,14,"And he called the name of the first, Jemimah: and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch."
18,42,15,"And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren."
18,42,16,"And after this Job lived a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, `even' four generations."
18,42,17,"So Job died, being old and full of days."
19,1,1,"Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, Nor standeth in the way of sinners, Nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers:"
19,1,2,"But his delight is in the law of Jehovah; And on his law doth he meditate day and night."
19,1,3,"And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water, That bringeth forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also doth not wither; And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper."
19,1,4,"The wicked are not so, But are like the chaff which the wind driveth away."
19,1,5,"Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous."
19,1,6,"For Jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous; But the way of the wicked shall perish."
19,2,1,"Why do the nations rage, And the peoples meditate a vain thing?"
19,2,2,"The kings of the earth set themselves, And the rulers take counsel together, Against Jehovah, and against his anointed, `saying',"
19,2,3,"Let us break their bonds asunder, And cast away their cords from us."
19,2,4,"He that sitteth in the heavens will laugh: The Lord will have them in derision."
19,2,5,"Then will he speak unto them in his wrath, And vex them in his sore displeasure:"
19,2,6,"Yet I have set my king Upon my holy hill of Zion."
19,2,7,"I will tell of the decree: Jehovah said unto me, Thou art my son; This day have I begotten thee."
19,2,8,"Ask of me, and I will give `thee' the nations for thine inheritance, And the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession."
19,2,9,"Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."
19,2,10,"Now therefore be wise, O ye kings: Be instructed, ye judges of the earth."
19,2,11,"Serve Jehovah with fear, And rejoice with trembling."
19,2,12,"Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, For his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all they that take refuge in him. Psalm 3 A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son."
19,3,1,"Jehovah, how are mine adversaries increased! Many are they that rise up against me."
19,3,2,"Many there are that say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah"
19,3,3,"But thou, O Jehovah, art a shield about me; My glory and the lifter up of my head."
19,3,4,"I cry unto Jehovah with my voice, And he answereth me out of his holy hill. Selah"
19,3,5,"I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for Jehovah sustaineth me."
19,3,6,"I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people That have set themselves against me round about."
19,3,7,"Arise, O Jehovah; save me, O my God: For thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked."
19,3,8,"Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah: Thy blessing be upon thy people. Selah Psalm 4 For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of David."
19,4,1,"Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness; Thou hast set me at large `when I was' in distress: Have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer."
19,4,2,"O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor? `How long' will ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah"
19,4,3,"But know that Jehovah hath set apart for himself him that is godly: Jehovah will hear when I call unto him."
19,4,4,"Stand in awe, and sin not: Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah"
19,4,5,"Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, And put your trust in Jehovah."
19,4,6,"Many there are that say, Who will show us `any' good? Jehovah, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us."
19,4,7,"Thou hast put gladness in my heart, More than `they have' when their grain and their new wine are increased."
19,4,8,"In peace will I both lay me down and sleep; For thou, Jehovah, alone makest me dwell in safety. Psalm 5 For the Chief Musician; with the Nehiloth. A Psalm of David."
19,5,1,"Give ear to my words, O Jehovah, Consider my meditation."
19,5,2,"Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God; For unto thee do I pray."
19,5,3,"O Jehovah, in the morning shalt thou hear my voice; In the morning will I order `my prayer' unto thee, and will keep watch."
19,5,4,"For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: Evil shall not sojourn with thee."
19,5,5,"The arrogant shall not stand in thy sight: Thou hatest all workers of iniquity."
19,5,6,"Thou wilt destroy them that speak lies: Jehovah abhorreth the blood-thirsty and deceitful man."
19,5,7,"But as for me, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness will I come into thy house: In thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple."
19,5,8,"Lead me, O Jehovah, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; Make thy way straight before my face."
19,5,9,"For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; Their inward part is very wickedness; Their throat is an open sepulchre; They flatter with their tongue."
19,5,10,"Hold them guilty, O God; Let them fall by their own counsels; Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions; For they have rebelled against thee."
19,5,11,"But let all those that take refuge in thee rejoice, Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: Let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee."
19,5,12,"For thou wilt bless the righteous; O Jehovah, thou wilt compass him with favor as with a shield. Psalm 6 For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments, set to the Sheminith. A Psalm of David."
19,6,1,"O Jehovah, rebuke me not in thine anger, Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure."
19,6,2,"Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; for I am withered away: O Jehovah, heal me; for my bones are troubled."
19,6,3,"My soul also is sore troubled: And thou, O Jehovah, how long?"
19,6,4,"Return, O Jehovah, deliver my soul: Save me for thy lovingkindness' sake."
19,6,5,"For in death there is no remembrance of thee: In Sheol who shall give thee thanks?"

19,105,25,"He turned their heart to hate his people, To deal subtly with his servants."
19,105,26,"He sent Moses his servant, `And' Aaron whom he had chosen."
19,105,27,"They set among them his signs, And wonders in the land of Ham."
19,105,28,"He sent darkness, and made it dark; And they rebelled not against his words."
19,105,29,"He turned their waters into blood, And slew their fish."
19,105,30,"Their land swarmed with frogs In the chambers of their kings."
19,105,31,"He spake, and there came swarms of flies, And lice in all their borders."
19,105,32,"He gave them hail for rain, `And' flaming fire in their land."
19,105,33,"He smote their vines also and their fig-trees, And brake the trees of their borders."
19,105,34,"He spake, and the locust came, And the grasshopper, and that without number,"
19,105,35,"And did eat up every herb in their land, And did eat up the fruit of their ground."
19,105,36,"He smote also all the first-born in their land, The chief of all their strength."
19,105,37,"And he brought them forth with silver and gold; And there was not one feeble person among his tribes."
19,105,38,"Egypt was glad when they departed; For the fear of them had fallen upon them."
19,105,39,"He spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to give light in the night."
19,105,40,"They asked, and he brought quails, And satisfied them with the bread of heaven."
19,105,41,"He opened the rock, and waters gushed out; They ran in the dry places `like' a river."
19,105,42,"For he remembered his holy word, `And' Abraham his servant."
19,105,43,"And he brought forth his people with joy, `And' his chosen with singing."
19,105,44,"And he gave them the lands of the nations; And they took the labor of the peoples in possession:"
19,105,45,"That they might keep his statutes, And observe his laws. Praise ye Jehovah."
19,106,1,"Praise ye Jehovah. Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness `endureth' forever."
19,106,2,"Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah, Or show forth all his praise?"
19,106,3,"Blessed are they that keep justice, And he that doeth righteousness at all times."
19,106,4,"Remember me, O Jehovah, with the favor that thou bearest unto thy people; Oh visit me with thy salvation,"
19,106,5,"That I may see the prosperity of thy chosen, That I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, That I may glory with thine inheritance."
19,106,6,"We have sinned with our fathers, We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly."
19,106,7,"Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; They remembered not the multitude of thy lovingkindnesses, But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea."
19,106,8,"Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, That he might make his mighty power to be known."
19,106,9,"He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up: So he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness."
19,106,10,"And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy."
19,106,11,"And the waters covered their adversaries; There was not one of them left."
19,106,12,"Then believed they his words; They sang his praise."
19,106,13,"They soon forgat his works; They waited not for his counsel,"
19,106,14,"But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, And tempted God in the desert."
19,106,15,"And he gave them their request, But sent leanness into their soul."
19,106,16,"They envied Moses also in the camp, `And' Aaron the saint of Jehovah."
19,106,17,"The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, And covered the company of Abiram."
19,106,18,"And a fire was kindled in their company; The flame burned up the wicked."
19,106,19,"They made a calf in Horeb, And worshipped a molten image."
19,106,20,"Thus they changed their glory For the likeness of an ox that eateth grass."
19,106,21,"They forgat God their Saviour, Who had done great things in Egypt,"
19,106,22,"Wondrous works in the land of Ham, `And' terrible things by the Red Sea."
19,106,23,"Therefore he said that he would destroy them, Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy `them'."
19,106,24,"Yea, they despised the pleasant land, They believed not his word,"
19,106,25,"But murmured in their tents, And hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah."
19,106,26,"Therefore he sware unto them, That he would overthrow them in the wilderness,"
19,106,27,"And that he would overthrow their seed among the nations, And scatter them in the lands."
19,106,28,"They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, And ate the sacrifices of the dead."
19,106,29,"Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings; And the plague brake in upon them."
19,106,30,"Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment; And so the plague was stayed."
19,106,31,"And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness, Unto all generations for evermore."
19,106,32,"They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes;"
19,106,33,"Because they were rebellious against his spirit, And he spake unadvisedly with his lips."
19,106,34,"They did not destroy the peoples, As Jehovah commanded them,"
19,106,35,"But mingled themselves with the nations, And learned their works,"
19,106,36,"And served their idols, Which became a snare unto them."
19,106,37,"Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,"
19,106,38,"And shed innocent blood, Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with blood."
19,106,39,"Thus were they defiled with their works, And played the harlot in their doings."
19,106,40,"Therefore was the wrath of Jehovah kindled against his people, And he abhorred his inheritance."
19,106,41,"And he gave them into the hand of the nations; And they that hated them ruled over them."
19,106,42,"Their enemies also oppressed them, And they were brought into subjection under their hand."
19,106,43,"Many times did he deliver them; But they were rebellious in their counsel, And were brought low in their iniquity."
19,106,44,"Nevertheless he regarded their distress, When he heard their cry:"
19,106,45,"And he remembered for them his covenant, And repented according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses."
19,106,46,"He made them also to be pitied Of all those that carried them captive."
19,106,47,"Save us, O Jehovah our God, And gather us from among the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, And to triumph in thy praise."
19,106,48,"Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye Jehovah."
19,107,1,"O give thanks unto Jehovah; For he is good; For his lovingkindness `endureth' for ever."
19,107,2,"Let the redeemed of Jehovah say `so', Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary,"
19,107,3,"And gathered out of the lands, From the east and from the west, From the north and from the south."
19,107,4,"They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way; They found no city of habitation."
19,107,5,"Hungry and thirsty, Their soul fainted in them."
19,107,6,"Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he delivered them out of their distresses,"
19,107,7,"He led them also by a straight way, That they might go to a city of habitation."
19,107,8,"Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!"
19,107,9,"For he satisfieth the longing soul, And the hungry soul he filleth with good."
19,107,10,"Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, Being bound in affliction and iron,"
19,107,11,"Because they rebelled against the words of God, And contemned the counsel of the Most High:"
19,107,12,"Therefore he brought down their heart with labor; They fell down, and there was none to help."
19,107,13,"Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saved them out of their distresses."
19,107,14,"He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, And brake their bonds in sunder."
19,107,15,"Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!"
19,107,16,"For he hath broken the gates of brass, And cut the bars of iron in sunder."
19,107,17,"Fools because of their transgression, And because of their iniquities, are afflicted."
19,107,18,"Their soul abhorreth all manner of food; And they draw near unto the gates of death."
19,107,19,"Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saveth them out of their distresses."
19,107,20,"He sendeth his word, and healeth them, And delivereth `them' from their destructions."
19,107,21,"Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!"
19,107,22,"And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, And declare his works with singing."
19,107,23,"They that go down to the sea in ships, That do business in great waters;"
19,107,24,"These see the works of Jehovah, And his wonders in the deep."
19,107,25,"For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, Which lifteth up the waves thereof."
19,107,26,"They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths: Their soul melteth away because of trouble."
19,107,27,"They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, And are at their wits' end."
19,107,28,"Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he bringeth them out of their distresses."
19,107,29,"He maketh the storm a calm, So that the waves thereof are still."
19,107,30,"Then are they glad because they are quiet; So he bringeth them unto their desired haven."
19,107,31,"Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!"
19,107,32,"Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, And praise him in the seat of the elders."
19,107,33,"He turneth rivers into a wilderness, And watersprings into a thirsty ground;"
19,107,34,"A fruitful land into a salt desert, For the wickedness of them that dwell therein."
19,107,35,"He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water, And a dry land into watersprings."
19,107,36,"And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, That they may prepare a city of habitation,"
19,107,37,"And sow fields, and plant vineyards, And get them fruits of increase."

19,148,5,"Let them praise the name of Jehovah; For he commanded, and they were created."
19,148,6,"He hath also established them for ever and ever: He hath made a decree which shall not pass away."
19,148,7,"Praise Jehovah from the earth, Ye sea-monsters, and all deeps."
19,148,8,"Fire and hail, snow and vapor; Stormy wind, fulfilling his word;"
19,148,9,"Mountains and all hills; Fruitful trees and all cedars;"
19,148,10,"Beasts and all cattle; Creeping things and flying birds;"
19,148,11,"Kings of the earth and all peoples; Princes and all judges of the earth;"
19,148,12,"Both young men and virgins; Old men and children:"
19,148,13,"Let them praise the name of Jehovah; For his name alone is exalted; His glory is above the earth and the heavens."
19,148,14,"And he hath lifted up the horn of his people, The praise of all his saints; Even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye Jehovah."
19,149,1,"Praise ye Jehovah. Sing unto Jehovah a new song, And his praise in the assembly of the saints."
19,149,2,"Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King."
19,149,3,"Let them praise his name in the dance: Let them sing praises unto him with timbrel and harp."
19,149,4,"For Jehovah taketh pleasure in his people: He will beautify the meek with salvation."
19,149,5,"Let the saints exult in glory: Let them sing for joy upon their beds."
19,149,6,"`Let' the high praises of God `be' in their mouth, And a two-edged sword in their hand;"
19,149,7,"To execute vengeance upon the nations, And punishments upon the peoples;"
19,149,8,"To bind their kings with chains, And their nobles with fetters of iron;"
19,149,9,"To execute upon them the judgment written: This honor have all his saints. Praise ye Jehovah."
19,150,1,"Praise ye Jehovah. Praise God in his sanctuary: Praise him in the firmament of his power."
19,150,2,"Praise him for his mighty acts: Praise him according to his excellent greatness."
19,150,3,"Praise him with trumpet sound: Praise him with psaltery and harp."
19,150,4,"Praise him with timbrel and dance: Praise him with stringed instruments and pipe."
19,150,5,"Praise him with loud cymbals: Praise him with high sounding cymbals."
19,150,6,"Let everything that hath breath praise Jehovah. Praise ye Jehovah."
20,1,1,"The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:"
20,1,2,"To know wisdom and instruction; To discern the words of understanding;"
20,1,3,"To receive instruction in wise dealing, In righteousness and justice and equity;"
20,1,4,"To give prudence to the simple, To the young man knowledge and discretion:"
20,1,5,"That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; And that the man of understanding may attain unto sound counsels:"
20,1,6,"To understand a proverb, and a figure, The words of the wise, and their dark sayings."
20,1,7,"The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge; `But' the foolish despise wisdom and instruction."
20,1,8,"My son, hear the instruction of thy father, And forsake not the law of thy mother:"
20,1,9,"For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head, And chains about thy neck."
20,1,10,"My son, if sinners entice thee, Consent thou not."
20,1,11,"If they say, Come with us, Let us lay wait for blood; Let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause;"
20,1,12,"Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, And whole, as those that go down into the pit;"
20,1,13,"We shall find all precious substance; We shall fill our houses with spoil;"
20,1,14,"Thou shalt cast thy lot among us; We will all have one purse:"
20,1,15,"My son, walk not thou in the way with them; Refrain thy foot from their path:"
20,1,16,"For their feet run to evil, And they make haste to shed blood."
20,1,17,"For in vain is the net spread In the sight of any bird:"
20,1,18,"And these lay wait for their own blood; They lurk privily for their own lives."
20,1,19,"So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; It taketh away the life of the owners thereof."
20,1,20,"Wisdom crieth aloud in the street; She uttereth her voice in the broad places;"
20,1,21,"She crieth in the chief place of concourse; At the entrance of the gates, In the city, she uttereth her words:"
20,1,22,"How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? And scoffers delight them in scoffing, And fools hate knowledge?"
20,1,23,"Turn you at my reproof: Behold, I will pour out my spirit upon you; I will make known my words unto you."
20,1,24,"Because I have called, and ye have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man hath regarded;"
20,1,25,"But ye have set at nought all my counsel, And would none of my reproof:"
20,1,26,"I also will laugh in `the day of' your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;"
20,1,27,"When your fear cometh as a storm, And your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind; When distress and anguish come upon you."
20,1,28,"Then will they call upon me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently, but they shall not find me:"
20,1,29,"For that they hated knowledge, And did not choose the fear of Jehovah:"
20,1,30,"They would none of my counsel; They despised all my reproof."
20,1,31,"Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, And be filled with their own devices."
20,1,32,"For the backsliding of the simple shall slay them, And the careless ease of fools shall destroy them."
20,1,33,"But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely, And shall be quiet without fear of evil."
20,2,1,"My son, if thou wilt receive my words, And lay up my commandments with thee;"
20,2,2,"So as to incline thine ear unto wisdom, And apply thy heart to understanding;"
20,2,3,"Yea, if thou cry after discernment, And lift up thy voice for understanding;"
20,2,4,"If thou seek her as silver, And search for her as for hid treasures:"
20,2,5,"Then shalt thou understand the fear of Jehovah, And find the knowledge of God."
20,2,6,"For Jehovah giveth wisdom; Out of his mouth `cometh' knowledge and understanding:"
20,2,7,"He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright; `He is' a shield to them that walk in integrity;"
20,2,8,"That he may guard the paths of justice, And preserve the way of his saints."
20,2,9,"Then shalt thou understand righteousness and justice, And equity, `yea', every good path."
20,2,10,"For wisdom shall enter into thy heart, And knowledge shall be pleasant unto thy soul;"
20,2,11,"Discretion shall watch over thee; Understanding shall keep thee:"
20,2,12,"To deliver thee from the way of evil, From the men that speak perverse things;"
20,2,13,"Who forsake the paths of uprightness, To walk in the ways of darkness;"
20,2,14,"Who rejoice to do evil, And delight in the perverseness of evil;"
20,2,15,"Who are crooked in their ways, And wayward in their paths:"
20,2,16,"To deliver thee from the strange woman, Even from the foreigner that flattereth with her words;"
20,2,17,"That forsaketh the friend of her youth, And forgetteth the covenant of her God:"
20,2,18,"For her house inclineth unto death, And her paths unto the dead;"
20,2,19,"None that go unto her return again, Neither do they attain unto the paths of life:"
20,2,20,"That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, And keep the paths of the righteous."
20,2,21,"For the upright shall dwell in the land, And the perfect shall remain in it."
20,2,22,"But the wicked shall be cut off from the land, And the treacherous shall be rooted out of it."
20,3,1,"My son, forget not my law; But let thy heart keep my commandments:"
20,3,2,"For length of days, and years of life, And peace, will they add to thee."
20,3,3,"Let not kindness and truth forsake thee: Bind them about thy neck; Write them upon the tablet of thy heart:"
20,3,4,"So shalt thou find favor and good understanding In the sight of God and man."
20,3,5,"Trust in Jehovah with all thy heart, And lean not upon thine own understanding:"
20,3,6,"In all thy ways acknowledge him, And he will direct thy paths."
20,3,7,"Be not wise in thine own eyes; Fear Jehovah, and depart from evil:"
20,3,8,"It will be health to thy navel, And marrow to thy bones."
20,3,9,"Honor Jehovah with thy substance, And with the first-fruits of all thine increase:"
20,3,10,"So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, And thy vats shall overflow with new wine."
20,3,11,"My son, despise not the chastening of Jehovah; Neither be weary of his reproof:"
20,3,12,"For whom Jehovah loveth he reproveth; Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth."
20,3,13,"Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, And the man that getteth understanding."
20,3,14,"For the gaining of it is better than the gaining of silver, And the profit thereof than fine gold."
20,3,15,"She is more precious than rubies: And none of the things thou canst desire are to be compared unto her."
20,3,16,"Length of days is in her right hand; In her left hand are riches and honor."
20,3,17,"Her ways are ways of pleasantness, And all her paths are peace."
20,3,18,"She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: And happy is every one that retaineth her."
20,3,19,"Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth; By understanding he established the heavens."
20,3,20,"By his knowledge the depths were broken up, And the skies drop down the dew."
20,3,21,"My son, let them not depart from thine eyes; Keep sound wisdom and discretion:"
20,3,22,"So shall they be life unto thy soul, And grace to thy neck."
20,3,23,"Then shalt thou walk in thy way securely, And thy foot shall not stumble."
20,3,24,"When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: Yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet."
20,3,25,"Be not afraid of sudden fear, Neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh:"
20,3,26,"For Jehovah will be thy confidence, And will keep thy foot from being taken."
20,3,27,"Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, When it is in the power of thy hand to do it."
20,3,28,"Say not unto thy neighbor, Go, and come again, And to-morrow I will give; When thou hast it by thee."
20,3,29,"Devise not evil against thy neighbor, Seeing he dwelleth securely by thee."
20,3,30,"Strive not with a man without cause, If he have done thee no harm."
20,3,31,"Envy thou not the man of violence, And choose none of his ways."
20,3,32,"For the perverse is an abomination to Jehovah; But his friendship is with the upright."
20,3,33,"The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked; But he blesseth the habitation of the righteous."
20,3,34,"Surely he scoffeth at the scoffers; But he giveth grace unto the lowly."
20,3,35,"The wise shall inherit glory; But shame shall be the promotion of fools."
20,4,1,"Hear, `my' sons, the instruction of a father, And attend to know understanding:"
20,4,2,"For I give you good doctrine; Forsake ye not my law."
20,4,3,"For I was a son unto my father, Tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother."
20,4,4,"And he taught me, and said unto me: Let thy heart retain my words; Keep my commandments, and live;"
20,4,5,"Get wisdom, get understanding; Forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth;"
20,4,6,"Forsake her not, and she will preserve thee; Love her, and she will keep thee."
20,4,7,"Wisdom `is' the principal thing; `therefore' get wisdom; Yea, with all thy getting get understanding."
20,4,8,"Exalt her, and she will promote thee; She will bring thee to honor, when thou dost embrace her."
20,4,9,"She will give to thy head a chaplet of grace; A crown of beauty will she deliver to thee."
20,4,10,"Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; And the years of thy life shall be many."
20,4,11,"I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in paths of uprightness."
20,4,12,"When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; And if thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble."
20,4,13,"Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: Keep her; for she is thy life."
20,4,14,"Enter not into the path of the wicked, And walk not in the way of evil men."
20,4,15,"Avoid it, pass not by it; Turn from it, and pass on."
20,4,16,"For they sleep not, except they do evil; And their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall."
20,4,17,"For they eat the bread of wickedness, And drink the wine of violence."
20,4,18,"But the path of the righteous is as the dawning light, That shineth more and more unto the perfect day."
20,4,19,"The way of the wicked is as darkness: They know not at what they stumble."
20,4,20,"My son, attend to my words; Incline thine ear unto my sayings."
20,4,21,"Let them not depart from thine eyes; Keep them in the midst of thy heart."
20,4,22,"For they are life unto those that find them, And health to all their flesh."
20,4,23,"Keep thy heart with all diligence; For out of it are the issues of life."
20,4,24,"Put away from thee a wayward mouth, And perverse lips put far from thee."
20,4,25,"Let thine eyes look right on, And let thine eyelids look straight before thee."
20,4,26,"Make level the path of thy feet, And let all thy ways be established."
20,4,27,"Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: Remove thy foot from evil."
20,5,1,"My son, attend unto my wisdom; Incline thine ear to my understanding:"
20,5,2,"That thou mayest preserve discretion, And that thy lips may keep knowledge."
20,5,3,"For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And her mouth is smoother than oil:"
20,5,4,"But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword."
20,5,5,"Her feet go down to death; Her steps take hold on Sheol;"
20,5,6,"So that she findeth not the level path of life: Her ways are unstable, `and' she knoweth `it' not."
20,5,7,"Now therefore, `my' sons, hearken unto me, And depart not from the words of my mouth."
20,5,8,"Remove thy way far from her, And come not nigh the door of her house;"
20,5,9,"Lest thou give thine honor unto others, And thy years unto the cruel;"
20,5,10,"Lest strangers be filled with thy strength, And thy labors `be' in the house of an alien,"
20,5,11,"And thou mourn at thy latter end, When thy flesh and thy body are consumed,"
20,5,12,"And say, How have I hated instruction, And my heart despised reproof;"
20,5,13,"Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, Nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!"
20,5,14,"I was well-nigh in all evil In the midst of the assembly and congregation."
20,5,15,"Drink waters out of thine own cistern, And running waters out of thine own well."
20,5,16,"Should thy springs be dispersed abroad, And streams of water in the streets?"
20,5,17,"Let them be for thyself alone, And not for strangers with thee."
20,5,18,"Let thy fountain be blessed; And rejoice in the wife of thy youth."
20,5,19,"`As' a loving hind and a pleasant doe, Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; And be thou ravished always with her love."
20,5,20,"For why shouldest thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, And embrace the bosom of a foreigner?"
20,5,21,"For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah; And he maketh level all his paths."
20,5,22,"His own iniquities shall take the wicked, And he shall be holden with the cords of his sin."
20,5,23,"He shall die for lack of instruction; And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray."
20,6,1,"My son, if thou art become surety for thy neighbor, If thou hast stricken thy hands for a stranger;"
20,6,2,"Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, Thou art taken with the words of thy mouth."
20,6,3,"Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, Seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbor: Go, humble thyself, and importune thy neighbor;"
20,6,4,"Give not sleep to thine eyes, Nor slumber to thine eyelids;"
20,6,5,"Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand `of the hunter', And as a bird from the hand of the fowler."
20,6,6,"Go to the ant, thou sluggard; Consider her ways, and be wise:"
20,6,7,"Which having no chief, Overseer, or ruler,"
20,6,8,"Provideth her bread in the summer, And gathereth her food in the harvest."
20,6,9,"How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?"
20,6,10,"`Yet' a little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to sleep:"
20,6,11,"So shall thy poverty come as a robber, And thy want as an armed man."
20,6,12,"A worthless person, a man of iniquity, Is he that walketh with a perverse mouth;"
20,6,13,"That winketh with his eyes, that speaketh with his feet, That maketh signs with his fingers;"
20,6,14,"In whose heart is perverseness, Who deviseth evil continually, Who soweth discord."
20,6,15,"Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; On a sudden shall he be broken, and that without remedy."
20,6,16,"There are six things which Jehovah hateth; Yea, seven which are an abomination unto him:"
20,6,17,"Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that shed innocent blood;"
20,6,18,"A heart that deviseth wicked purposes, Feet that are swift in running to mischief,"
20,6,19,"A false witness that uttereth lies, And he that soweth discord among brethren."
20,6,20,"My son, keep the commandment of thy father, And forsake not the law of thy mother:"
20,6,21,"Bind them continually upon thy heart; Tie them about thy neck."
20,6,22,"When thou walkest, it shall lead thee; When thou sleepest, it shall watch over thee; And when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee."
20,6,23,"For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; And reproofs of instruction are the way of life:"
20,6,24,"To keep thee from the evil woman, From the flattery of the foreigner's tongue."
20,6,25,"Lust not after her beauty in thy heart; Neither let her take thee with her eyelids."
20,6,26,"For on account of a harlot `a man is brought' to a piece of bread; And the adulteress hunteth for the precious life."
20,6,27,"Can a man take fire in his bosom, And his clothes not be burned?"
20,6,28,"Or can one walk upon hot coals, And his feet not be scorched?"
20,6,29,"So he that goeth in to his neighbor's wife; Whosoever toucheth her shall not be unpunished."
20,6,30,"Men do not despise a thief, if he steal To satisfy himself when he is hungry:"
20,6,31,"But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; He shall give all the substance of his house."
20,6,32,"He that committeth adultery with a woman is void of understanding: He doeth it who would destroy his own soul."
20,6,33,"Wounds and dishonor shall he get; And his reproach shall not be wiped away."
20,6,34,"For jealousy is the rage of a man; And he will not spare in the day of vengeance."
20,6,35,"He will not regard any ransom; Neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts."
20,7,1,"My son, keep my words, And lay up my commandments with thee."
20,7,2,"Keep my commandments and live; And my law as the apple of thine eye."
20,7,3,"Bind them upon thy fingers; Write them upon the tablet of thy heart."
20,7,4,"Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; And call understanding `thy' kinswoman:"
20,7,5,"That they may keep thee from the strange woman, From the foreigner that flattereth with her words."
20,7,6,"For at the window of my house I looked forth through my lattice;"
20,7,7,"And I beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, A young man void of understanding,"
20,7,8,"Passing through the street near her corner; And he went the way to her house,"
20,7,9,"In the twilight, in the evening of the day, In the middle of the night and in the darkness."
20,7,10,"And, behold, there met him a woman With the attire of a harlot, and wily of heart."
20,7,11,"She is clamorous and wilful; Her feet abide not in her house:"
20,7,12,"Now she is in the streets, now in the broad places, And lieth in wait at every corner."
20,7,13,"So she caught him, and kissed him, `And' with an impudent face she said unto him:"
20,7,14,"Sacrifices of peace-offerings are with me; This day have I paid my vows."
20,7,15,"Therefore came I forth to meet thee, Diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee."
20,7,16,"I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, With striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt."
20,7,17,"I have perfumed my bed With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon."
20,7,18,"Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; Let us solace ourselves with loves."
20,7,19,"For the man is not at home; He is gone a long journey:"
20,7,20,"He hath taken a bag of money with him; He will come home at the full moon."
20,7,21,"With her much fair speech she causeth him to yield; With the flattering of her lips she forceth him along."
20,7,22,"He goeth after her straightway, As an ox goeth to the slaughter, Or as `one in' fetters to the correction of the fool;"
20,7,23,"Till an arrow strike through his liver; As a bird hasteth to the snare, And knoweth not that it is for his life."
20,7,24,"Now therefore, `my' sons, hearken unto me, And attend to the words of my mouth."
20,7,25,"Let not thy heart decline to her ways; Go not astray in her paths."
20,7,26,"For she hath cast down many wounded: Yea, all her slain are a mighty host."
20,7,27,"Her house is the way to Sheol, Going down to the chambers of death."
20,8,1,"Doth not wisdom cry, And understanding put forth her voice?"
20,8,2,"On the top of high places by the way, Where the paths meet, she standeth;"
20,8,3,"Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, At the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud:"
20,8,4,"Unto you, O men, I call; And my voice is to the sons of men."
20,8,5,"O ye simple, understand prudence; And, ye fools, be of an understanding heart."
20,8,6,"Hear, for I will speak excellent things; And the opening of my lips shall be right things."
20,8,7,"For my mouth shall utter truth; And wickedness is an abomination to my lips."
20,8,8,"All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; There is nothing crooked or perverse in them."
20,8,9,"They are all plain to him that understandeth, And right to them that find knowledge."
20,8,10,"Receive my instruction, and not silver; And knowledge rather than choice gold."
20,8,11,"For wisdom is better than rubies; And all the things that may be desired are not to be compared unto it."
20,8,12,"I wisdom have made prudence my dwelling, And find out knowledge `and' discretion."
20,8,13,"The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil: Pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, And the perverse mouth, do I hate."
20,8,14,"Counsel is mine, and sound knowledge: I am understanding; I have might."
20,8,15,"By me kings reign, And princes decree justice."
20,8,16,"By me princes rule, And nobles, `even' all the judges of the earth."
20,8,17,"I love them that love me; And those that seek me diligently shall find me."
20,8,18,"Riches and honor are with me; `Yea', durable wealth and righteousness."
20,8,19,"My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; And my revenue than choice silver."
20,8,20,"I walk in the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of justice;"
20,8,21,"That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance, And that I may fill their treasuries."
20,8,22,"Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way, Before his works of old."
20,8,23,"I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, Before the earth was."
20,8,24,"When there were no depths, I was brought forth, When there were no fountains abounding with water."
20,8,25,"Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills was I brought forth;"
20,8,26,"While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, Nor the beginning of the dust of the world."
20,8,27,"When he established the heavens, I was there: When he set a circle upon the face of the deep,"
20,8,28,"When he made firm the skies above, When the fountains of the deep became strong,"
20,8,29,"When he gave to the sea its bound, That the waters should not transgress his commandment, When he marked out the foundations of the earth;"
20,8,30,"Then I was by him, `as' a master workman; And I was daily `his' delight, Rejoicing always before him,"
20,8,31,"Rejoicing in his habitable earth; And my delight was with the sons of men."
20,8,32,"Now therefore, `my' sons, hearken unto me; For blessed are they that keep my ways."
20,8,33,"Hear instruction, and be wise, And refuse it not."
20,8,34,"Blessed is the man that heareth me, Watching daily at my gates, Waiting at the posts of my doors."
20,8,35,"For whoso findeth me findeth life, And shall obtain favor of Jehovah."
20,8,36,"But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: All they that hate me love death."
20,9,1,"Wisdom hath builded her house; She hath hewn out her seven pillars:"
20,9,2,"She hath killed her beasts; She hath mingled her wine; She hath also furnished her table:"
20,9,3,"She hath sent forth her maidens; She crieth upon the highest places of the city:"
20,9,4,"Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: As for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him,"
20,9,5,"Come, eat ye of my bread, And drink of the wine which I have mingled."
20,9,6,"Leave off, ye simple ones, and live; And walk in the way of understanding."
20,9,7,"He that correcteth a scoffer getteth to himself reviling; And he that reproveth a wicked man `getteth' himself a blot."
